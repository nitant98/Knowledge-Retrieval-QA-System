### Learning Outcome: evaluate whether a security, given its current market price and a value estimate, is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued by the market

Introduction:
In the world of financial analysis, one crucial aspect is the evaluation of whether a security is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued by the market. This task requires a thorough understanding of the concepts and tools of equity valuation, as well as a skillful application of these principles. In this technical note, we will explore the CFA curriculum's key concepts and principles to effectively evaluate the market's assessment of a security's value.

Material/Method:
The CFA curriculum highlights several key tools for equity valuation, such as discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, and price-to-book (P/B) ratio. DCF analysis involves forecasting a company's future cash flows and discounting them to present value using an appropriate discount rate. P/E ratio compares a company's stock price to its earnings per share, providing a measure of how much the market is willing to pay for each dollar of earnings. P/B ratio compares a company's stock price to its book value per share, providing insight into the company's asset value.

Results/Discussion:
To determine whether a security is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued, a financial analyst must compare its market price to its estimated intrinsic value. If a security's market price is higher than its intrinsic value, it is considered overvalued, and vice versa for undervalued securities. Fairly valued securities have a market price that aligns with their estimated intrinsic value. A careful analysis of a security's fundamentals and market conditions is necessary to make an accurate assessment.

Conclusion:
Evaluating whether a security is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued is a crucial task in financial analysis

### Learning Outcome:  describe major categories of equity valuation models

Introduction:
Equity valuation models are essential tools for financial analysts to analyze and determine the fair value of a company's stock. These models provide a framework for evaluating different investment opportunities and help in making informed investment decisions. In this technical note, we will discuss the major categories of equity valuation models that are covered in the CFA curriculum.

Material/Method:
There are three major categories of equity valuation models: asset-based models, income-based models, and market-based models. Asset-based models focus on the company's financial statements and calculate the value of its assets. Income-based models use the company's expected future cash flows to determine its value. Market-based models compare the company's stock price to other similar stocks in the market.

Results/Discussion:
Asset-based models include the cost-based method and the liquidation value method. The cost-based method calculates the value of the company's assets by subtracting the liabilities from the total assets. The liquidation value method calculates the value of the company's assets in case of liquidation. Income-based models include the discounted cash flow (DCF) method and the residual income method. The DCF method calculates the present value of the company's future cash flows, while the residual income method compares the company's expected earnings with its cost of equity. Market-based models include the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, price-to-book (P/B) ratio, and price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. These models use ratios based on the company's stock price and financial metrics to determine its value.

Conclusion:
Equity valuation models are essential for financial analysts to make informed investment decisions. The three major categories of models, namely asset-based, income-based, and market-based, provide a comprehensive

### Learning Outcome:  describe regular cash dividends, extra dividends, stock dividends, stock splits, reverse stock splits, and share repurchases

Introduction:
Regular cash dividends, extra dividends, stock dividends, stock splits, reverse stock splits, and share repurchases are key concepts in equity valuation that are critical for financial analysts to understand when analyzing a company's financials. In this technical note, we will provide a concise summary of these concepts from the CFA curriculum.

Material/Method:
The concepts of regular cash dividends, extra dividends, stock dividends, stock splits, reverse stock splits, and share repurchases are covered in the CFA curriculum under the Equity Investments topic (Study Session 14) in the Level I exam. The material is divided into six sections, with each section focusing on a specific concept and providing examples.

Results/Discussion:
Regular cash dividends are the most common type of dividend, which are paid out of a company's earnings to its shareholders on a regular basis. Extra dividends are one-time payments, usually higher than regular cash dividends, and are usually declared when a company has excess cash. Stock dividends are payments made in the form of additional shares rather than cash. Stock splits increase the number of shares outstanding while maintaining the same total market value. Reverse stock splits, on the other hand, decrease the number of shares outstanding and increase the price per share. Share repurchases occur when a company buys back its own shares from the market.

Conclusion:
Understanding the various types of dividends and corporate actions such as stock splits, reverse stock splits, and share repurchases is crucial for financial analysts to properly value a company's stock. These concepts are important in analyzing a company's financial health and potential future returns for shareholders. As such, it is imperative for financial analysts to have a strong grasp on these concepts when performing equity valuation.

### Learning Outcome:  describe dividend payment chronology

Introduction:

Dividend payment chronology is a crucial concept in equity valuation that determines the timing and amount of dividend payments to shareholders. It is an important aspect of understanding a company's financial health and its attractiveness as an investment opportunity. In this technical note, we will discuss the key concepts and principles related to dividend payment chronology as outlined in the CFA curriculum.

Material/Method:

The CFA curriculum outlines the following key concepts related to dividend payment chronology: declaration date, ex-dividend date, record date, and payment date. The declaration date is when a company's board of directors announces the dividend. The ex-dividend date is when the stock begins trading without the dividend included. The record date is when the company determines which shareholders are eligible to receive the dividend. The payment date is when the dividend is actually paid out to eligible shareholders.

Results/Discussion:

Understanding the dividend payment chronology can help financial analysts determine the potential income stream for shareholders and evaluate the financial stability of a company. It also impacts the stock price, as the stock typically trades at a lower price after the ex-dividend date to adjust for the dividend payment. Additionally, analysts can use this information to predict future dividend payments and assess the company's dividend policy.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, dividend payment chronology is a critical aspect of equity valuation that determines the timing and amount of dividend payments to shareholders. It is essential for financial analysts to understand and apply these concepts to accurately evaluate a company's attractiveness as an investment opportunity. By paying close attention to the dividend payment chronology, analysts can gain valuable insights into a company's financial health and make informed investment decisions.

### Learning Outcome:  explain the rationale for using present value models to value equity and describe the dividend discount and free-cash-flow-to-equity models

Introduction:
Present value models are crucial tools for equity valuation, as they provide a framework for calculating the intrinsic value of a company's stock. In the CFA curriculum, two commonly used present value models for equity valuation are the dividend discount model (DDM) and the free-cash-flow-to-equity model (FCFE). These models use the concept of present value to determine the worth of a company's stock to provide valuable insights for financial analysts.

Material/Method:
The rationale for using present value models to value equity lies in the fundamental finance principle of time value of money. The present value allows analysts to discount future cash flow streams to their current value, taking into account the potential for reinvestment and risk. The DDM calculates the present value of a stock by discounting future dividends, while the FCFE model calculates the present value based on the company's free cash flow to equity.

Results/Discussion:
The DDM model is based on the assumption that the value of a stock is determined by the present value of all future dividends. It takes into account the company's dividend policy, growth rate, and required rate of return to compute the present value of the stock. On the other hand, the FCFE model focuses on the company's ability to generate free cash flow and its potential for future growth. It takes into account the company's capital expenditures, working capital requirements, and other investments to determine the present value of the stock.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, present value models, such as DDM and FCFE, are essential tools for equity valuation as they provide a basis for estimating the intrinsic value of a company's stock. These models help investors make more informed decisions when evaluating potential investments. As a financial

### Learning Outcome:  calculate the intrinsic value of a non-callable, non-convertible preferred stock

Intro:
In the field of equity valuation, understanding the intrinsic value of a security is crucial for making informed investment decisions. This technical note will provide a concise overview of the key concepts and principles from the CFA curriculum for calculating the intrinsic value of a non-callable, non-convertible preferred stock.

Material/Method:
To determine the intrinsic value of a non-callable, non-convertible preferred stock, we need to consider the security's perpetuity formula, as well as factors such as the stock's dividend rate, required rate of return, and growth rate. The perpetuity formula is calculated by dividing the stock's annual dividend by the required rate of return.

Results/Discussion:
In applying this formula, the higher the dividend rate and the lower the required rate of return, the higher the intrinsic value of the preferred stock. On the other hand, a higher growth rate may lead to a higher intrinsic value, but this must also be balanced with the risk involved in achieving that growth.

Conclusion:
It is important for financial analysts to have a solid understanding of the concepts and principles involved in calculating the intrinsic value of a non-callable, non-convertible preferred stock. By considering the perpetuity formula and relevant factors such as dividend rate, required rate of return, and growth rate, analysts can make informed decisions about the value and potential return of this type of security.

### Learning Outcome:  calculate and interpret the intrinsic value of an equity security based on the Gordon (constant) growth dividend discount model or a two-stage dividend discount model, as appropriate

INTRODUCTION: 
Understanding the concept of intrinsic value is crucial for financial analysts as it allows them to determine the true worth of an equity security. Two commonly used models for calculating intrinsic value are the Gordon (constant) growth dividend discount model and the two-stage dividend discount model. In this technical note, we will explore the key principles and methods for calculating and interpreting the intrinsic value of an equity security using these models. 

MATERIAL/METHOD:
The Gordon (constant) growth dividend discount model estimates the intrinsic value of a stock by taking the present value of its future dividends. It assumes that dividends will grow at a constant rate indefinitely and discounts them using the required rate of return. On the other hand, the two-stage dividend discount model accounts for a phase of higher dividend growth followed by a stable growth phase. It calculates the present value of both phases and adds them to obtain the intrinsic value of the stock.

RESULTS/DISCUSSION:
When using the Gordon model, the intrinsic value of a stock can be calculated by dividing its expected dividend by the difference between the required rate of return and the dividend growth rate. For example, if a stock is expected to pay a dividend of $5 next year, with a required rate of return of 10% and a dividend growth rate of 5%, its intrinsic value would be ($5/10%-5%) = $100. In the two-stage model, more complex calculations are involved, including estimating the duration of each phase and using different discount rates.

CONCLUSION:
In conclusion, understanding the concepts and principles of the Gordon (constant) growth dividend discount model and the two-stage dividend discount model is crucial for determining the intrinsic value of an equity security. These models provide a framework for estimating the

### Learning Outcome:  identify characteristics of companies for which the constant growth or a multistage dividend discount model is appropriate

Introduction:
The constant growth and multistage dividend discount models are widely used methods for equity valuation. However, it is important for financial analysts to understand the characteristics of companies for which these models are most suitable. In this technical note, we will identify these characteristics based on the CFA curriculum, helping analysts make informed decisions when valuing equity using these models.

Material/Method:
Our analysis is based on the CFA curriculum's discussion of the constant growth and multistage dividend discount models. We have reviewed the relevant sections of the curriculum and extracted key characteristics of companies that make them suitable for these models. Our findings are summarized below.

Results/Discussion:
Our analysis shows that the constant growth model is most appropriate for companies with stable and predictable earnings and dividends. This model assumes a constant growth rate in dividends, making it ideal for mature, established companies with a long history of paying dividends. On the other hand, the multistage dividend discount model is suitable for companies with fluctuating earnings and dividends. This model allows for different growth rates for each stage, making it suitable for fast-growing companies in their growth phase.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, it is important for financial analysts to consider the characteristics of a company before using the constant growth or multistage dividend discount model for equity valuation. Companies with stable and predictable earnings and dividends are best valued using the constant growth model, while those with fluctuating earnings and dividends are better suited for the multistage model. Understanding these differences can help analysts make more accurate and informed decisions when valuing equity using these models.

### Learning Outcome:  explain the rationale for using price multiples to value equity, how the price to earnings multiple relates to fundamentals, and the use of multiples based on comparables

Introduction:
Price multiples are an essential tool used by financial analysts to value equity. They provide a simple yet effective method for investors to compare the relative value of different companies within the same industry. This technical note will explore the rationale for using price multiples, specifically the price to earnings (P/E) multiple, and how it relates to fundamental analysis, as well as the use of multiples based on comparables in the CFA curriculum.

Material/Method:
The P/E multiple is calculated by dividing the price per share by the earnings per share of a company. This multiple helps investors determine how much they are paying for a company's earnings. A higher P/E multiple indicates that the market is willing to pay a premium for a company's expected earnings, while a lower P/E multiple suggests that the market has a lower expectation for a company's future earnings. In fundamental analysis, the P/E multiple is used to assess a company's earnings growth potential and determine if its current valuation is justified.

Results/Discussion:
Using multiples based on comparables allows for a more comprehensive analysis of a company's valuation. By comparing a company's P/E multiple to that of its industry peers, analysts can identify undervalued or overvalued companies within the same sector. This approach takes into account differences in company size, profitability, and growth potential, providing a more accurate assessment of a company's value.

Conclusion:
Price multiples, especially the P/E multiple, are widely accepted tools for valuing equity. They help investors assess the relative value of a company and its growth potential. By utilizing multiples based on comparables, analysts can gain a better understanding of a company's valuation compared to its peers. Understanding the rationale for using price multiples and how they relate to

### Learning Outcome:  calculate and interpret the following multiples: price to earnings, price to an estimate of operating cash flow, price to sales, and price to book value

Intro:
This technical note aims to provide financial analysts with a concise overview of key concepts and principles related to the calculation and interpretation of price multiples in equity valuation. Specifically, the note will cover four commonly used multiples: price to earnings, price to an estimate of operating cash flow, price to sales, and price to book value.

Material/Method:
The calculation of each of the four price multiples is fairly straightforward and can be done by dividing the company's market price per share by a relevant financial metric. For price to earnings, the market price per share is divided by the company's earnings per share. Price to an estimate of operating cash flow is calculated by dividing the market price per share by the company's estimated operating cash flow per share. Price to sales is simply the market price per share divided by the company's sales per share. Finally, price to book value is determined by dividing the market price per share by the company's book value per share.

Results/Discussion:
Interpreting these multiples can provide valuable insights into a company's valuation. Price to earnings, for example, reflects the amount an investor is willing to pay for each dollar of the company's earnings. A higher multiple may indicate that investors have higher expectations for the company's future earnings growth. Price to an estimate of operating cash flow, on the other hand, can provide a sense of a company's ability to generate cash and its overall financial health. A lower multiple may suggest that the company is undervalued compared to its peers. Price to sales is useful for companies with negative or volatile earnings, as it ignores earnings and focuses on revenue. Finally, price to book value can provide insight into a company's asset value and can be useful for evaluating companies in

### Learning Outcome:  describe enterprise value multiples and their use in estimating equity value

Intro:
Enterprise value multiples are essential tools for understanding the value of a company. As a financial analyst, it is important to have a strong grasp of these concepts in order to accurately estimate equity value and make informed investment decisions. In this technical note, we will discuss the key principles and uses of enterprise value multiples as outlined in the CFA curriculum.

Material/Method:
Enterprise value multiples are ratios that compare a company's enterprise value to a specific financial metric, such as earnings or cash flow. The enterprise value represents the total value of a company's equity and debt, while the chosen financial metric reflects the company's earnings power or operational performance. These multiples provide a holistic view of a company's value, as they take into account both its equity and debt.

Results/Discussion:
One of the main uses of enterprise value multiples is in estimating the equity value of a company. By dividing the enterprise value by the chosen financial metric, analysts can determine the market value of the company's equity. This is a more accurate measure of a company's value compared to just looking at its stock price, as it considers the impact of the company's debt. Additionally, enterprise value multiples can be used to compare companies in the same industry, as they provide a standardized measure of value.

Conclusion:
Enterprise value multiples are an important concept for financial analysts to understand as they provide a more comprehensive view of a company's value and can be used to accurately estimate equity value. By considering both equity and debt, these multiples can help analysts make informed investment decisions and compare companies in the same industry. It is crucial for financial analysts to have a strong understanding of these concepts in order to effectively evaluate investment opportunities.

### Learning Outcome:  describe asset-based valuation models and their use in estimating equity value

Intro:
Asset-based valuation models are widely used in the valuation of equity, providing an estimate of a company's worth based on its underlying assets. These models consider both tangible and intangible assets to determine a company's intrinsic value.

Material/Method:
There are two main types of asset-based valuation models: liquidation value and going concern value. The liquidation value method calculates the value of a company's assets if it were to be liquidated, while the going concern value method estimates the value of a company as a functioning business. Both methods rely on the analysis of a company's balance sheet and its assets and liabilities.

Results/Discussion:
Asset-based valuation models can provide a more conservative estimate of a company's equity value, as they do not take into account future cash flows or other intangible factors like brand value or market share. However, they can be useful in certain industries or situations where a company's assets make up a significant portion of its value, such as in the real estate or manufacturing industries. Additionally, these models can provide a baseline valuation for a company, which can be adjusted based on other factors.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, asset-based valuation models are important tools for financial analysts in estimating a company's equity value. They provide a holistic view of a company's assets and liabilities, and can be particularly useful in certain industries or situations. However, it is important to consider other factors and use these models as a starting point for further analysis.

### Learning Outcome:  explain advantages and disadvantages of each category of valuation model.

Intro:
Valuation is a crucial concept in the financial world as it helps investors determine the true worth of an investment. There are various methods of valuation, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. In this technical note, we will explore the different categories of valuation models and their respective pros and cons.

Material/Method:
The three main categories of valuation models are the income approach, market approach, and asset-based approach. The income approach involves forecasting future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The market approach uses comparable companies or transactions to determine the value of a company. The asset-based approach looks at a company's balance sheet and adjusts the assets and liabilities to their fair market value.

Results/Discussion:
The income approach is often considered the most reliable as it takes into account the company's projected future performance. However, it heavily relies on assumptions and is less accurate when dealing with companies that have unpredictable cash flows. The market approach is relatively easier to use and provides a more accurate valuation for companies with comparable peers. However, it may not reflect the true value of a company if there are limited comparable companies or if the market is not efficient. The asset-based approach is useful for companies with significant tangible assets, but it does not consider intangible assets and future growth potential.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, each category of valuation model has its own strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, it is essential to consider the specific characteristics of a company and choose the appropriate valuation model accordingly. A combination of multiple valuation methods may also provide a more comprehensive and accurate valuation. As a financial analyst, it is crucial to understand the advantages and disadvantages of each approach to make informed investment decisions.
