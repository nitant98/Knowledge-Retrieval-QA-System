The cost of debt is the after-tax cost to the issuer of debt, based on the return that debt investors require to finance a company. The cost of equity represents the return that equity investors require to own a company, also referred to as the required rate of return on equity or the required return on equity. A company’s WACC is used by the company’s internal decision makers to evaluate capital investments. For analysts and investors, it is a critical input used in company valuation. Equation (1) shows how a company’s WACC is driven by the proportions, or weights (the w i ), of the different capital sources used in its capital structure, applied to the costs of each source (the r i ): WACC = w d r d (1 – t) + w p r p + w e r e , where d , p , and e denote debt, preferred equity, and common equity, respectively. These weights are all non-negative and sum to 1.0. Determining a company’s WACC is an important, albeit challenging, task for an analyst given the following: Many different methods can be used to calculate the costs of each source of capital; there is no single, “right” method. Assumptions are needed regarding long-term target capital structure, which might or might not be the current capital structure. The company’s marginal tax rate must be estimated and might be different from its average or effective tax rate. Estimating the cost of capital for a company thus involves numerous, sometimes complex, assumptions and choices, all of which affect the resulting investment conclusion.","The member should be able to: explain top-down and bottom-up factors that impact the cost of capital, compare methods used to estimate the cost of debt, explain historical and forward-looking approaches to estimating an equity risk premium, compare methods used to estimate the required return on equity, estimate the cost of debt or required return on equity for a public company and a private company, and evaluate a company’s capital structure and cost of capital relative to peers.

Capital raised from sources other than public markets and traditional institutions and in the form of an equity investment is called private equity (PE). Similarly sourced capital extended to companies through a loan or other form of debt is referred to as private debt. Private capital relates to the entire capital structure, including PE and private debt. Private capital largely consists of private investment funds and entities that invest in the equity or debt securities of privately held companies, real estate, or other assets. Many private investment firms have PE and private debt arms; however, these teams typically refrain from investing in the same assets or businesses to avoid overexposure to a single investment and to avoid the conflict of interest that arises from being invested in both the equity and debt of an issuer. Private investment firms, even those with private debt arms, typically are referred to as PE firms. Although PE is the largest component of private capital, PE as a comprehensive generic category is inaccurate because other forms of private alternative finance have grown considerably in size and popularity.","The member should be able to: explain investment characteristics of private equity, explain investment characteristics of private debt, explain investment characteristics of real estate, explain investment characteristics of infrastructure, explain investment characteristics of natural resources, and explain investment characteristics of hedge funds.","Private capital is a broad term used for funding provided to companies sourced from neither the PE nor public debt markets. Capital provided in the form of equity investments is called PE, whereas capital provided as a loan or other form of debt is called private debt. PE refers to investment in privately owned companies or in public companies intended to be taken private. Key PE investment strategies include leveraged buyouts (e.g., management buyouts [MBOs] and management buy-ins [MBIs]) and venture capital. Primary exit strategies include trade sale, initial public offerings (IPO), and recapitalization. Private debt refers to various forms of debt provided by investors to private entities. Key private debt strategies include direct lending, mezzanine debt, and venture debt. Private debt also includes specialized strategies, such as collateralized loan obligation (CLOs), unitranche debt, real estate debt, and infrastructure debt.

In particular, the relationship between spot and forward commitment prices was established as the opportunity cost of owning the underlying asset (represented by the risk-free rate) as well as any additional cost or benefit associated with holding the underlying asset. This price relationship both prevents arbitrage and allows a forward commitment to be replicated using spot market transactions and risk-free borrowing or lending. n the first lesson, we explore the pricing and valuation of forward commitments on a mark-to-market (MTM) basis from inception through maturity. This analysis is essential for issuers, investors, and financial intermediaries to assess the value of any asset or liability portfolio that includes these instruments. The second lesson addresses forward pricing for the special case of underlying assets with different maturities, such as interest rates, credit spreads, and volatility. The prices of these forward commitments across the so-called term structure are important building blocks for pricing swaps and related instruments in later lessons.","The member should be able to: explain how the value and price of a forward contract are determined at initiation, during the life of the contract, and at expiration; and explain how forward rates are determined for an underlying with a term structure and describe their uses.","A forward commitment price agreed upon at contract inception remains fixed and establishes the basis on which the underlying asset (or cash) will be exchanged in the future versus the spot price at maturity. For an underlying asset that does not generate cash flows, the value of a long forward commitment before expiration is equal to the current spot price of the underlying asset minus the present value of the forward price discounted at the risk-free rate. The reverse is true for a short forward commitment. Foreign exchange represents a special case in which the spot versus forward price is a function of the difference between risk-free rates across currencies. For an underlying asset with additional costs and benefits, the forward contract MTM value is adjusted by the sum of the present values of all additional cash flows through maturity. Underlying assets with a term structure, such as interest rates, have different rates or prices for different times-to-maturity. These zero or spot and forward rates are derived from coupon bonds and market reference rates and establish the building blocks of interest rate derivatives pricing. Implied forward rates represent a breakeven reinvestment rate linking short-dated and long-dated zero-coupon bonds over a specific period. A forward rate agreement (FRA) is a contract in which counterparties agree to apply a specific interest rate to a future period.

It allows the analyst to estimate using more complex models with multiple explanatory variables and, if used correctly, may lead to better predictions, better portfolio construction, or better understanding of the drivers of security returns. If used incorrectly, however, multiple linear regression may yield spurious relationships, lead to poor predictions, and offer a poor understanding of relationships. The analyst must first specify the model and make several decisions in this process. The analyst must answer the following questions: What is the dependent variable of interest? What independent variables are important? What form should the model take? What is the goal of the model—prediction or understanding of the relationship? The analyst specifies the dependent and independent variables and then employs software to estimate the model and produce related statistics. The good news is that the software does the estimation (see Exhibit 1). The analyst’s primary tasks are to specify the model and interpret the output from this software, which are the main subjects of this content.

In practice, multiple regressions are used to explain relationships between financial variables, to test existing theories, or to make forecasts. The regression process covers several decisions the analyst must make, such as identifying the dependent and independent variables, selecting the appropriate regression model, testing if the assumptions behind linear regression are satisfied, examining goodness of fit, and making needed adjustments. We have presented the multiple linear regression model and discussed violations of regression assumptions, model specification and misspecification, and models with qualitative variables. A multiple regression model is represented by the following equation: Y i = b 0 + b 1 X 1 i + b 2 X 2 i + b 3 X 3 i + … + b k X ki + ε i , i = 1, 2, 3, …, n , where Y is the dependent variable, X s are the independent variables from 1 to k , and the model is estimated using n observations. Coefficient b 0 is the model’s “intercept,” representing the expected value of Y if all independent variables are zero. Parameters b 1 to b k are the slope coefficients (or partial regression coefficients) for independent variables X 1 to X k . Slope coefficient b j describes the impact of independent variable X j on Y , holding all the other independent variables constant. Five main assumptions underlying multiple regression models must be satisfied: (1) linearity, (2) homoskedasticity, (3) independence of errors, (4) normality, and (5) independence of independent variables. Diagnostic plots can help detect whether these assumptions are satisfied. Scatterplots of dependent versus and independent variables are useful for detecting nonlinear relationships, while residual plots are useful for detecting violations of homoskedasticity and independence of errors.

Forward commitments and contingent claims were distinguished by their different payoff profiles and other characteristics. We now turn our attention to the pricing and valuation of these instruments. As a first step, we explore how the price of a forward commitment is related to the spot price of an underlying asset in a way that does not allow for arbitrage opportunities. Specifically, the strategy of replication shows that identical payoffs to a forward commitment can be achieved from spot market transactions combined with borrowing or lending at the risk-free rate. Finally, the second lesson demonstrates how costs or benefits associated with owning an underlying asset affect the forward commitment price.","The member should be able to: explain how the concepts of arbitrage and replication are used in pricing derivatives, and explain the difference between the spot and expected future price of an underlying and the cost of carry associated with holding the underlying asset.","Forward commitments are an alternative means of taking a long or short position in an underlying asset. A link between forward prices and spot prices exists to prevent investors from taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities across cash and derivative instruments. A forward commitment may be replicated with a long or short spot position in the underlying asset and borrowing or lending at a risk-free rate. Investors can recreate a variety of positions by using appropriate combinations of spot, forward, and risk-free positions. The risk-free rate provides a fundamental link between spot and forward prices for underlying assets with no additional costs or benefits of ownership. The cost of carry is the net of the costs and benefits related to owning an underlying asset for a specific period and must be factored into the difference between the spot price and a forward price of a specific underlying asset. The cost of carry may include costs, such as storage and insurance for physical commodities, or benefits of ownership, such as dividends for stocks and interest for bonds. Foreign exchange represents a special case in which the cost of carry is the interest rate differential between two currencies. Forward prices may be greater than or less than the underlying spot price, depending on the specific cost of carry associated with owning the underlying asset.

In doing so, we contrasted the asymmetry of one-sided option payoffs with the linear or symmetric payoff of forwards and underlying assets. We now extend this analysis to show how to combine options to have an equivalent payoff to that of the underlying and a risk-free asset as well as a forward commitment. In the first lesson, we demonstrate that the value of a European call may be used to derive the value of a European put option with the same underlying details, and vice versa, under a no-arbitrage condition referred to as put–call parity. In the second lesson, we show how this may be extended to forward commitments and how the put–call parity relationship may be applied to option and other investment strategies. We will focus on European options on underlying assets with no income or benefit.","The member should be able to: explain put–call parity for European options, and explain put–call forward parity for European options.","Put–call parity establishes a relationship that allows the price of a call option to be derived from the price of a put option with the same underlying details and vice versa. Put–call parity holds for European options with the same exercise price and expiration date, representing a no-arbitrage relationship between put option, call option, underlying asset, and risk-free asset prices. If put–call parity does not hold, then riskless arbitrage profit opportunities may be available to investors. Put–call forward parity extends the put–call parity relationship to forward contracts given the equivalence of an underlying asset position and a long forward contract plus a risk-free bond. Under put–call forward parity, we may demonstrate that a purchased put option and a sold call option are equivalent to a long risk-free bond and short forward position, and a sold put and purchased call are equivalent to a long forward and short risk-free bond. Put–call parity may be applied beyond option-based strategies in finance—for example, to demonstrate that equityholders have a position equivalent to a purchased call option on the value of the firm with unlimited upside, while debtholders have a sold put option position on firm value with limited upside.

A measure for identifying a high-leverage point is leverage. If leverage is greater than 3 ( k + 1 _ n ) , where k is the number of independent variables, then the observation is potentially influential. A measure for identifying an outlier is studentized residuals. If the studentized residual is greater than the critical value of the t-statistic with n – k – 2 degrees of freedom, then the observation is potentially influential. Cook’s distance, or Cook’s D (Di), is a metric for identifying influential data points. It measures how much the estimated values of the regression change if observation i is deleted. If D i > 2 √ _ k / n , then it is highly likely to be influential. An influence plot visually presents leverage, studentized residuals, and Cook’s D for each observation. Dummy, or indicator, variables represent qualitative independent variables and take a value of 1 (for true) or 0 (for false) to indicate whether a specific condition applies, such as whether a company belongs to a certain industry sector. To capture n possible categories, the model must include n – 1 dummy variables. An intercept dummy adds to or reduces the original intercept if a specific condition is met. When the intercept dummy is 1, the regression line shifts up or down parallel to the base regression line. A slope dummy allows for a changing slope if a specific condition is met. When the slope dummy is 1, the slope changes to (dj + bj) × Xj, where dj is the coefficient on the dummy variable and bj is the slope of Xj in the original regression line. A logistic regression model is one with a qualitative (i.e., categorical) dependent variable, so logistic regression is often used in binary classification problems, which are common in machine learning and neural networks. To estimate a logistic regression, the logistic transformation of the event probability (P) into the log odds, ln[P/(1 − P)], is applied, which linearizes the relation between the transformed dependent variable and the independent variables. Logistic regression coefficients are typically estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method, and slope coefficients are interpreted as the change in the log odds that the event happens per unit change in the independent variable, holding all other independent variables constant.

We will focus on how analysts use industry information and corporate disclosures to forecast a company’s future financial results. Financial forecasts are the basis for fundamental equity valuation based on discounted cash flows and/or market multiples. An effective forecast model must be based on a thorough understanding of a company’s business, management, strategy, external environment, and historical results. Thus, an analyst begins with a review of the company and its environment—its industry, key products, strategic position, management, competitors, suppliers, and customers. Using this information, an analyst identifies key revenue and cost drivers and assesses the likely impact of relevant trends, such as economic conditions and technological developments. An analyst’s understanding of the fundamental drivers of the business and an assessment of future events provide a basis for developing inputs to the forecast model. We begin our discussion with an overview of developing a forecast model. We then describe the general approach to forecasting each component of the income statement (revenue, operating costs, and non-operating costs), balance sheet, and cash flow statement. We then turn to special topics: the impact of competitive factors on prices and costs; the effects of inflation and deflation; technological developments; long-term forecasting; and building a company model.

Many companies use mergers as a means to achieve growth or gain operational efficiencies. Others seek to acquire unique capabilities or resources, increase market power, or diversify their businesses. In all cases, it is important for both equity and fixed income analysts to understand the motives for mergers and their financial and operational consequences. Merger and acquisition (M&A) activities involve a variety of complexities and risks. Analysts should assess these factors, including the expected value arising from a proposed business combination relative to deal price, in addition to the likelihood that the combination will take place and the intended results will be achieved. They should also consider actions taken by other shareholders, regulators, market participants, and competitors, in addition to transaction specifics, given the potential impact of all these factors on deal completion and valuation. Analysts should be able to answer questions such as: Does the proposed transaction make economic sense and align with management’s stated business strategy? How is the transaction being financed, and how will this financing approach affect company financials? How likely is the deal to take place, and what are associated risks? In the case of a hostile bid, does the target company have options to successfully fend off the unwanted bid? What is the anticipated impact for shareholders? Bondholders? Example 1 Takeda–Shire Acquisition On 5 December 2018, shareholders of Takeda Pharmaceutical, a 237-year-old company and Japan’s largest pharmaceutical firm, approved the acquisition of Shire, a UK-listed, Irish-headquartered drug maker of similar size with an operational base in the United States. Announced in May 2018, the US$62 billion deal was aimed at transforming Takeda into a top 10 global pharmaceutical company with a sizable US footprint. It was the largest deal announced worldwide for 2018. The deal was also the largest international acquisition ever attempted by a Japanese company. Takeda’s offer consisted of shares and cash. It also involved a US$30 billion increase in balance sheet debt. Takeda’s CEO undertook a nine-month-long campaign to secure the deal. The deal was confirmed in December 2018 with 88% Takeda shareholder approval, despite significant resistance from some Takeda shareholders, including the original Takeda family, who were concerned about the additional risk created by the acquisition. Takeda–Shire Deal Timeline Strategy September 2016 Takeda’s “Vision 2025” business plan envisions sustaining growth year over year. Rumor 28 March 2018 Takeda says “considering making an approach to Shire.” 6 April Takeda, Pfizer, and Amgen viewed as likely bidders for Shire. Courtship 29 March 2018 Takeda initial offer: £44/share, with £16 in cash. 11 April Takeda second offer: £45.5/share, £16.75 cash. 13 April Takeda third offer: £46.5/share, £17.75 cash. 14 April Shire’s board announces it unanimously rejects third offer. 20 April Takeda fourth offer: £47/share, £21 cash. 24 April Takeda fifth offer: £49/share, £21.75 cash. Acquisition 8 May 2018 Shire accepts fifth offer of £49/share, £21.75 cash, valuing deal at US$62 billion. 14 May Takeda announces asset disposals to help fund the acquisition. 10 July US Federal Trade Commission grants regulatory approval for Shire deal. 14 September Chinese regulator approves Shire deal. 18 October Japanese regulator approves Shire deal. 20 November EU regulator approves Shire deal. 20 November Proxy advisors Glass, Lewis & Co. and Institutional Shareholder Services recommend deal. May–November 2018 Takeda minority shareholders (including Takeda family) lobby against proposed deal, citing increased risk and loss of Japanese “roots.” Integration 5 December 2018 Takeda shareholders vote to approve deal. 7 January 2019 Takeda CEO announces integration “well underway.” 8 January 2019 Deal closes. Value creation 14 May 2019 CEO announces 43% increase in original cost synergies anticipated from acquisition. December 2019 Takeda’s core earnings margin expected to reach 25%, with long-term earnings margin forecast for 35%, up from an earnings margin of 22% in 2018. March 2020 Takeda sales expected to rise 57% year over year. Projection for 2023 Divestments of US$10 billion expected to stabilize balance sheet, with the expansion of five key businesses including in neuroscience and in treatments for cancer and rare diseases. Takeda’s motivations for the deal included the potential for sustainable earnings growth believed to be available through Shire’s products and markets. Takeda was at that time projecting declining profitability from existing products and limited growth in the Japanese market. Additionally, synergies through new product development, earnings diversification, and cost savings were anticipated from the deal. Despite positive expectations, in the nine months between Takeda’s announcement in March 2018 and the time the deal closed, Takeda’s share price dropped 26% while Shire’s rose 33%. Following increasing offers in value by Takeda, a series of regulatory approvals post–Shire acceptance, and announcements of a divestments program to help fund the acquisition, the deal finally closed in January 2019. By May 2019, Takeda’s management was reporting significant cost savings and projecting major improvements to core earnings margins in the years ahead. This reading will discuss many of the issues involved in M&A deals, such as form of payment in a merger, legal and contractual issues, and the necessity for regulatory approval. Most importantly, this reading aims to equip you with basic tools and a framework for analyzing such deals. In subsequent sections, we will discuss basic types of M&A, underlying motives, transaction characteristics, governing regulations, and how to evaluate a target company and a proposed merger.","The member should be able to: classify merger and acquisition (M&A) activities based on forms of integration and relatedness of business activities; explain common motivations behind M&A activity; explain bootstrapping of EPS and calculate a company’s post-merger EPS; explain, based on industry life cycles, the relation between merger motivations and types of mergers; contrast merger transaction characteristics by form of acquisition, method of payment, and attitude of target management; distinguish among pre-offer and post-offer takeover defense mechanisms; compare the discounted cash flow, comparable company, and comparable transaction analyses for valuing a target company, including the advantages and disadvantages of each; evaluate a takeover bid and its effects on the target shareholders versus the acquirer shareholders; explain how price and payment method affect the distribution of risks and benefits in M&A transactions; describe characteristics of M&A transactions that create value; distinguish among equity carve-outs, spin-offs, split-offs, and liquidation; explain common reasons for restructuring.","Mergers and acquisitions are complex transactions. The process often involves not only the acquiring and target companies but also a variety of other stakeholders, including competition law regulatory agencies. To fully evaluate a merger, analysts must ask two fundamental questions: First, will the transaction create value; and second, does the acquisition price outweigh the potential benefit? This reading has made the following important points. An acquisition is the purchase of some portion of one company by another. A merger represents the absorption of one company by another such that only one entity survives following the transaction. Mergers can be categorized by the form of integration. In a statutory merger, one company is merged into another; in a subsidiary merger, the target becomes a subsidiary of the acquirer; and in a consolidation, both the acquirer and target become part of a newly formed company. Horizontal mergers occur among peer companies engaged in the same kind of business. Vertical mergers occur among companies along a given value chain. Conglomerates are formed by companies in unrelated businesses. Merger activity tends to be concentrated in industries undergoing changes, such as deregulation or technological advancement. The motives for M&A activity include synergy, growth, market power, the acquisition of unique capabilities and resources, diversification, increased earnings, management’s personal incentives, tax considerations, and the possibilities of uncovering hidden value. Cross-border motivations may involve technology transfer, product differentiation, government policy, and the opportunities to serve existing clients abroad. A merger transaction may take the form of a stock purchase (when the acquirer gives the target company’s shareholders some combination of cash or securities in exchange for shares of the target company’s stock) or an asset purchase (when the acquirer purchases the target company’s assets and payment is made directly to the target company). The decision of which approach to take will affect other aspects of the transaction, such as how approval is obtained, which laws apply, how the liabilities are treated, and how the shareholders and the company are taxed. The method of payment for a merger can be cash, securities, or a mixed offering with some of both. The exchange ratio in a stock or mixed offering determines the number of shares that stockholders in the target company will receive in exchange for each of their shares in the target company. Hostile transactions are those opposed by target managers, whereas friendly transactions are endorsed by the target company’s managers. There are a variety of both pre- and post-offer defenses a target can use to ward off an unwanted takeover bid. Examples of pre-offer defense mechanisms include poison pills and puts, incorporation in a jurisdiction with restrictive takeover laws, staggered boards of directors, restricted voting rights, supermajority voting provisions, fair price amendments, and golden parachutes. Examples of post-offer defenses include the “just say no” defense, litigation, greenmail, share repurchases, leveraged recapitalization, “crown jewel” defense, Pac-Man ® defense, or finding a white knight or a white squire. Competition law prohibits mergers and acquisitions that impede competition. Three major tools for valuing a target company are discounted cash flow analysis (which involves discounting free cash flows estimated with pro forma financial statements), comparable company analysis (which estimates a company’s intrinsic value based on relative valuation metrics for similar companies), and comparable transaction analysis (which derives valuation from details of recent takeover transactions for comparable companies). In a merger bid, the gain to target shareholders is measured as the control premium, which equals the price paid for the target company in excess of its value. The acquirer gains equal the value of any synergies created by the merger minus the premium paid to target shareholders. Together, the bid and the method of payment determine the distribution of risks and returns among acquirer and target shareholders with regard to realization of synergies as well as correct estimation of the target company’s value. The empirical evidence suggests that merger transactions create value for target company shareholders. Acquirers, in contrast, tend to accrue value in the years following a merger. This finding suggests that synergies are often overestimated or difficult to achieve. When a company decides to sell, liquidate, or spin off a division or a subsidiary, it is referred to as a divestiture. Companies may divest assets for a variety of reasons, including a change in strategic focus, poor fit of the asset within the corporation, reverse synergy, or cash flow needs. The three basic ways that a company divests assets are a sale to another company, a spin-off to shareholders, and liquidation.

We then need to determine the amount we need to invest, if we are saving, or the cost of borrowing, if we are shopping for a loan. As investment analysts, much of our work also involves evaluating transactions with present and future cash flows. When we place a value on any security, for example, we are attempting to determine the worth of a stream of future cash flows. To carry out all the above tasks accurately, we must understand the mathematics of time value of money problems. Money has time value in that individuals value a given amount of money more highly the earlier it is received. Therefore, a smaller amount of money now may be equivalent in value to a larger amount received at a future date. The time value of money as a topic in investment mathematics deals with equivalence relationships between cash flows with different dates. Mastery of time value of money concepts and techniques is essential for investment analysts. The reading is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces some terminology used throughout the reading and supplies some economic intuition for the variables we will discuss. Section 3 tackles the problem of determining the worth at a future point in time of an amount invested today. Section 4 addresses the future worth of a series of cash flows. These two sections provide the tools for calculating the equivalent value at a future date of a single cash flow or series of cash flows. Sections 5 and 6 discuss the equivalent value today of a single future cash flow and a series of future cash flows, respectively. In Section 7, we explore how to determine other quantities of interest in time value of money problems.","The member should be able to: interpret interest rates as required rates of return, discount rates, or opportunity costs; explain an interest rate as the sum of a real risk-free rate and premiums that compensate investors for bearing distinct types of risk; calculate and interpret the effective annual rate, given the stated annual interest rate and the frequency of compounding; solve time value of money problems for different frequencies of compounding; calculate and interpret the future value (FV) and present value (PV) of a single sum of money, an ordinary annuity, an annuity due, a perpetuity (PV only), and a series of unequal cash flows; demonstrate the use of a time line in modeling and solving time value of money problems.","In this reading, we have explored a foundation topic in investment mathematics, the time value of money. We have developed and reviewed the following concepts for use in financial applications: The interest rate, r , is the required rate of return; r is also called the discount rate or opportunity cost. An interest rate can be viewed as the sum of the real risk-free interest rate and a set of premiums that compensate lenders for risk: an inflation premium, a default risk premium, a liquidity premium, and a maturity premium. The future value, FV, is the present value, PV, times the future value factor, (1 + r ) N . The interest rate, r , makes current and future currency amounts equivalent based on their time value. The stated annual interest rate is a quoted interest rate that does not account for compounding within the year. The periodic rate is the quoted interest rate per period; it equals the stated annual interest rate divided by the number of compounding periods per year. The effective annual rate is the amount by which a unit of currency will grow in a year with interest on interest included. An annuity is a finite set of level sequential cash flows. There are two types of annuities, the annuity due and the ordinary annuity. The annuity due has a first cash flow that occurs immediately; the ordinary annuity has a first cash flow that occurs one period from the present (indexed at t = 1). On a time line, we can index the present as 0 and then display equally spaced hash marks to represent a number of periods into the future. This representation allows us to index how many periods away each cash flow will be paid. Annuities may be handled in a similar approach as single payments if we use annuity factors rather than single-payment factors. The present value, PV, is the future value, FV, times the present value factor, (1 + r ) − N . The present value of a perpetuity is A/r , where A is the periodic payment to be received forever. It is possible to calculate an unknown variable, given the other relevant variables in time value of money problems. The cash flow additivity principle can be used to solve problems with uneven cash flows by combining single payments and annuities.

Advancements include the use of Big Data, AI, and ML to evaluate investment opportunities, optimize portfolios, and mitigate risks. These developments are affecting not only quantitative asset managers but also fundamental asset managers who make use of these tools and technologies to engage in hybrid forms of investment decision making. Investment advisory services are undergoing changes with the growth of automated wealth advisers or “robo-advisers.” Robo-advisers might assist investors without the intervention of a human adviser, or they might be used in combination with a human adviser. The desired outcome is the ability to provide tailored, actionable advice to investors with greater ease of access and at lower cost. In the area of financial record keeping, blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) are creating new ways to record, track, and store transactions for financial assets. An early example of this trend is the cryptocurrency bitcoin, but the technology is being considered in a broader set of applications. This reading is divided into seven main sections, which together define fintech and outline some of its key areas of impact in the field of investment management. Section 1 explains the concept and areas of fintech. Sections 2 and 3 discuss Big Data, AI, and ML. Section 4 discusses data science, and Sections 5–8 provide applications of fintech to investment management. Sections 9 and 10 examine DLT. A summary of key points completes the reading.","The member should be able to: describe “fintech;” describe Big Data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning; describe fintech applications to investment management; describe financial applications of distributed ledger technology.","The term “fintech” refers to technological innovation in the design and delivery of financial services and products. Areas of fintech development include the analysis of large datasets, analytical techniques, automated trading, automated advice, and financial record keeping. Big Data is characterized by the three Vs—volume, velocity, and variety—and includes both traditional and nontraditional (or alternative) datasets. Among the main sources of alternative data are data generated by individuals, business processes, and sensors. AI computer systems are capable of performing tasks that traditionally required human intelligence at levels comparable (or superior) to those of human beings. ML seeks to extract knowledge from large amounts of data by “learning” from known examples and then generating structure or predictions. Simply put, ML algorithms aim to “find the pattern, apply the pattern.” The main types of ML include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and deep learning. Natural language processing (NLP) is an application of text analytics that uses insight into the structure of human language to analyze and interpret text- and voice-based data. Robo-advisory services are providing automated advisory services to increasing numbers of retail investors. Services include asset allocation, portfolio optimization, trade execution, rebalancing, and tax strategies. Big Data and ML techniques could provide insights into real-time and changing market circumstances to identify weakening or adverse trends in advance, allowing for improved risk management and investment decision making. Algorithmic traders use automated trading programs to determine when, where, and how to trade an order on the basis of specified rules and market conditions. Benefits include speed of executions, lower trading costs, and anonymity. Blockchain and DLT might offer a new way to store, record, and track financial assets on a secure, distributed basis. Applications include cryptocurrencies and tokenization. Additionally, DLT could bring efficiencies to post-trade and compliance processes through automation, smart contracts, and identity verification.

Investor allocations to public and private real estate have increased significantly over the last 20 years. Because of the distinct characteristics of real estate property, real estate investments tend to behave differently from other asset classes—such as stocks, bonds, and commodities—and thus have different risks and diversification benefits. Private real estate investments are further differentiated because the investments are not publicly traded and require analytic techniques different from those of publicly traded assets. Because of the lack of directly comparable transactions, an appraisal process is required to value real estate property. Many of the indexes and benchmarks used for private real estate also rely on appraisals. Because of this characteristic, they behave differently from indexes for publicly traded equities, such as the S&P 500, MSCI Europe, FTSE Asia Pacific, and many other regional and global indexes.","The member should be able to: compare the characteristics, classifications, principal risks, and basic forms of public and private real estate investments; explain portfolio roles and economic value determinants of real estate investments; discuss commercial property types, including their distinctive investment characteristics; explain the due diligence process for both private and public equity real estate investments; and discuss real estate investment indexes, including their construction and potential biases.","General Characteristics of Real Estate Real estate investments can occur in four basic forms: private equity (direct ownership), publicly traded equity (indirect ownership claim), private debt (direct mortgage lending), and publicly traded debt (securitized mortgages). Many motivations exist for investing in real estate income property. The key factors are current income, price appreciation, inflation hedge, diversification, and tax benefits. Adding equity real estate investments to a traditional portfolio will potentially have diversification benefits because of the less-than-perfect correlation of equity real estate returns with returns to stocks and bonds. If the income stream can be adjusted for inflation and real estate prices increase with inflation, then equity real estate investments may provide an inflation hedge. Debt investors in real estate expect to receive their return from promised cash flows and typically do not participate in any appreciation in value of the underlying real estate. Thus, debt investments in real estate are similar to other fixed-income investments, such as bonds. Regardless of the form of real estate investment, the value of the underlying real estate property can affect the performance of the investment with location being a critical factor in determining the value of a real estate property. Real estate property has some unique characteristics compared with other investment asset classes. These characteristics include heterogeneity and fixed location, high unit value, management intensiveness, high transaction costs, depreciation, sensitivity to the credit market, illiquidity, and difficulty of value and price determination. There are many different types of real estate properties in which to invest. The main commercial (income-producing) real estate property types are office, industrial and warehouse, retail, and multifamily. Other types of commercial properties typically are classified by their specific use. Certain risk factors are common to commercial property, but each property type is likely to have a different susceptibility to these factors. The key risk factors that can affect commercial real estate include business condition, lead time for new development, excess supply, cost and availability of capital, unexpected inflation, demographics, lack of liquidity, environmental issues, availability of information, management expertise, and leverage. Location, lease structures, and economic factors—such as economic growth, population growth, employment growth, and consumer spending—affect the value of each property type.

Short-term funds without explicit interest rates, such as accounts payable, are part of working capital management, which is the management of short-term assets and liabilities. Other debt and equity obligations used to finance the business longer term are considered part of the firm’s capital structure. The goal of effective working capital management is to ensure that a company has adequate, ready access to the funds necessary for day-to-day operations, while at the same time making sure that the company’s assets are invested in the most productive way. The goal of capital structure management is to balance the risks and costs of the firm’s long-term finances. In this reading, we examine a variety of debt and equity claims that companies rely on for their sources of capital.

Key stakeholder groups include the company’s capital providers, otherwise referred to as its debt- and equityholders. In addition, companies have a number of other interested parties. These stakeholder groups do not necessarily share the same goals for, nor seek the same ends from, the company. The interests of any one stakeholder group may diverge or conflict with that of others and, in some cases, with the interests of the company itself. A company’s ability to maximize long-term value for shareholders and generate sufficient profitability to make its debt obligations is compromised if one stakeholder group is able to consistently extract benefits to the detriment of another group. Therefore, the controls and mechanisms to harmonize and safeguard the interests of the company’s stakeholders are key areas of both interest and risk for financial analysts.","The member should be able to: describe a company’s stakeholder groups and compare their interests; describe the principal–agent relationship and conflicts that may arise between stakeholder groups; describe corporate governance and mechanisms to manage stakeholder relationships and mitigate associated risks; describe both the potential risks of poor corporate governance and stakeholder management and the benefits from effective corporate governance and stakeholder management; describe environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations in investment analysis; and describe ESG investment approaches.","The investment community is increasingly recognizing and quantifying environmental and social considerations and the impacts of corporate governance in the investment process. Analysts who understand these considerations can better evaluate their associated implications and risks for an investment decision. Following are the core concepts covered in this reading: The primary stakeholder groups of a corporation consist of shareholders, creditors, the board of directors, managers and employees, customers, suppliers, and government and regulators. A principal–agent relationship (or agency relationship) entails a principal hiring an agent to perform a particular task or service. In a company, both the board of directors and management act in an agent capacity to represent the interests of shareholder principals. Conflicts occur when the interests of various stakeholder groups diverge and when the interests of one group are compromised for the benefit of another. Stakeholder management involves identifying, prioritizing, and understanding the interests of stakeholder groups and managing the company’s relationships with stakeholders. Mechanisms to mitigate shareholder risks include company reporting and transparency, general meetings, investor activism, derivative lawsuits, and corporate takeovers. Mechanisms to mitigate creditor risks include bond indenture(s), company reporting and transparency, and committee participation. Mechanisms to mitigate board risks include board or management meetings and board committees. Remaining mechanisms to mitigate risks for other stakeholder (employees, customers, suppliers, and regulators) include policies, laws, regulations, and codes. Executive (internal) directors are employed by the company and are typically members of senior management. Nonexecutive (external) directors have limited involvement in daily operations but serve an important oversight role. Two primary duties of a board of directors are duty of care and duty of loyalty. A company’s board of directors typically has several committees that are responsible for specific functions and report to the board. Although the types of committees may vary across organization, the most common are the audit committee, governance committee, remuneration (compensation) committee, nomination committee, risk committee, and investment committee. Shareholder activism encompasses a range of strategies that may be used by shareholders when seeking to compel a company to act in a desired manner. From a corporation’s perspective, risks of poor governance include weak control systems; ineffective decision making; and legal, regulatory, reputational, and default risk. Benefits include better operational efficiency, control, and operating and financial performance, as well as lower default risk (or cost of debt), which enhances shareholder value. Key analyst considerations in corporate governance and stakeholder management include economic ownership and voting control, board of directors’ representation, remuneration and company performance, investor composition, strength of shareholders’ rights, and the management of long-term risks. Environmental and social issues, such as climate change, air pollution, and societal impacts of a company’s products and services, historically have been treated as negative externalities. Increased stakeholder awareness and strengthening regulations, however, are internalizing environmental and societal costs into the company’s income statement by responsible investors. ESG investment approaches are value based or values based. The six common ESG investment approaches are negative screening, positive screening, ESG integration, thematic investing, engagement or active ownership, and impact investing.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/capital-budgeting-l1.pdf,Corporate Finance,2021,Level I,"Capital budgeting is the process that companies use for decision making on capital projects—those projects with a life of a year or more. This is a fundamental area of knowledge for financial analysts for many reasons. First, capital budgeting is very important for corporations. Capital projects, which make up the long-term asset portion of the balance sheet, can be so large that sound capital budgeting decisions ultimately decide the future of many corporations. Capital decisions cannot be reversed at a low cost, so mistakes are very costly. Indeed, the real capital investments of a company describe a company better than its working capital or capital structures, which are intangible and tend to be similar for many corporations. Second, the principles of capital budgeting have been adapted for many other corporate decisions, such as investments in working capital, leasing, mergers and acquisitions, and bond refunding. Third, the valuation principles used in capital budgeting are similar to the valuation principles used in security analysis and portfolio management. Many of the methods used by security analysts and portfolio managers are based on capital budgeting methods. Conversely, there have been innovations in security analysis and portfolio management that have also been adapted to capital budgeting. Finally, although analysts have a vantage point outside the company, their interest in valuation coincides with the capital budgeting focus of maximizing shareholder value. Because capital budgeting information is not ordinarily available outside the company, the analyst may attempt to estimate the process, within reason, at least for companies that are not too complex. Further, analysts may be able to appraise the quality of the company’s capital budgeting process—for example, on the basis of whether the company has an accounting focus or an economic focus. This reading is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the steps in a typical capital budgeting process. After introducing the basic principles of capital budgeting in Section 3, in Section 4 we discuss the criteria by which a decision to invest in a project may be made.","The member should be able to: describe the capital budgeting process and distinguish among the various categories of capital projects; describe the basic principles of capital budgeting; explain how the evaluation and selection of capital projects is affected by mutually exclusive projects, project sequencing, and capital rationing; calculate and interpret net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), payback period, discounted payback period, and profitability index (PI) of a single capital project; explain the NPV profile, compare the NPV and IRR methods when evaluating independent and mutually exclusive projects, and describe the problems associated with each of the evaluation methods; contrast the NPV decision rule to the IRR decision rule and identify problems associated with the IRR rule; describe expected relations among an investment’s NPV, company value, and share price.","Capital budgeting is the process that companies use for decision making on capital projects—those projects with a life of a year or more. This reading developed the principles behind the basic capital budgeting model, the cash flows that go into the model, and several extensions of the basic model. Capital budgeting supports the most critical investments for many corporations—their investments in long-term assets. The principles of capital budgeting have been applied to other corporate investing and financing decisions and to security analysis and portfolio management. The typical steps in the capital budgeting process are: 1) generating ideas, 2) analyzing individual proposals, 3) planning the capital budget, and 4) monitoring and post-auditing. Types of projects appropriate for the capital budgeting process can be categorized as: 1) replacement, 2) expansion, 3) new products and services, and 4) regulatory, safety and environmental. Capital budgeting decisions are based on incremental after-tax cash flows discounted at the opportunity cost of funds. Financing costs are ignored because both the cost of debt and the cost of other capital are captured in the discount rate. The net present value (NPV) is the present value of all after-tax cash flows, or NPV = ∑ t = 0 n CF t ( 1 + r ) t where the investment outlays are negative cash flows included in the CF t s and where r is the required rate of return for the investment. The IRR is the discount rate that makes the present value of all future cash flows sum to zero. This equation can be solved for the IRR: ∑ t = 0 n CF t ( 1 + IRR ) t = 0 The payback period is the number of years required to recover the original investment in a project. The payback is based on cash flows. The discounted payback period is the number of years it takes for the cumulative discounted cash flows from a project to equal the original investment. The average accounting rate of return (AAR) can be defined as follows: AAR = Average net income Average book value The profitability index (PI) is the present value of a project’s future cash flows divided by the initial investment: PI = PV of future cash flows Initial investment = 1 + NPV Initial investment The capital budgeting decision rules are to invest if the NPV > 0, if the IRR > r , or if the PI > 1.0 There are no decision rules for the payback period, discounted payback period, and AAR because they are not always sound measures. The NPV profile is a graph that shows a project’s NPV graphed as a function of various discount rates. For mutually exclusive projects that are ranked differently by the NPV and IRR, it is economically sound to choose the project with the higher NPV. The “multiple IRR problem” and the “no IRR problem” can arise for a project with nonconventional cash flows—cash flows that change signs more than once during the project’s life. The fact that projects with positive NPVs theoretically increase the value of the company and the value of its stock could explain the popularity of NPV as an evaluation method.

The Level I curriculum presented the basic principles of this process and the major discounted cash flow (DCF) investment criteria: net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR). The payback period and the accounting rate of return also are commonly used, although they have drawbacks compared with DCF methods. This reading expands on the basic principles by projecting the cash flows needed in these models and applying the models to a variety of more complicated situations. This reading is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a crucial element of the capital budgeting process: organizing the cash flow information that is the raw material of the analysis. Section 3 looks further at cash flow analysis, considering alternative depreciation methods, replacement projects (in contract to expansion projects), and the effects of inflation. Section 4 demonstrates methods to extend the basic investment criteria to address economic alternatives and risk. These methods include mutually exclusive projects with differing lives, sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis, simulation models, and real options analysis. This section also discusses several common pitfalls in capital budgeting analysis. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the reading.","The member should be able to: calculate the yearly cash flows of expansion and replacement capital projects and evaluate how the choice of depreciation method affects those cash flows; explain how inflation affects capital budgeting analysis; evaluate capital projects and determine the optimal capital project in situations of 1) mutually exclusive projects with unequal lives, using either the least common multiple of lives approach or the equivalent annual annuity approach, and 2) capital rationing; explain how sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis, and Monte Carlo simulation can be used to assess the standalone risk of a capital project; describe types of real options relevant to a capital project; describe common capital budgeting pitfalls.","Capital budgeting is the process that companies use for decision making on capital projects—those projects with a life of a year or more. This reading developed the principles behind the basic capital budgeting model, the cash flows that go into the model, and several extensions of the basic model. Analysts often organize the cash flows for capital budgeting in tables, summing all of the cash flows occurring at each point in time. These totals are then used to find an NPV or IRR. Alternatively, tables collecting cash flows by type can be used. Equations for the capital budgeting cash flows are as follows: Initi al outlay: Outlay = FCInv + NWCInv − Sal 0 + t ( Sal 0 − B 0 ) Ann ual after-tax operating cash flow: CF = ( S − C − D ) ( 1 − t ) + D, or CF = ( S − C ) ( 1 − t ) + t D Ter minal year after-tax non-operating cash flow: TNOCF = Sal T + NWCInv − t ( Sal T − B T ) Depreciation schedules affect taxable income, taxes paid, and after-tax cash flows, and therefore capital budgeting valuations. When inflation exists, the analyst should perform capital budgeting analysis in “nominal” terms if cash flows are nominal and in “real” terms if cash flows are real. Inflation reduces the value of depreciation tax savings (unless the tax system adjusts depreciation for inflation). Inflation reduces the value of fixed payments to bondholders. Inflation usually does not affect all revenues and costs uniformly. Contracting with customers, suppliers, employees, and sources of capital can be complicated as inflation rises. Two ways of comparing mutually exclusive projects in a replacement chain are the “least common multiple of lives” approach and the “equivalent annual annuity” approach. For the least common multiple of lives approach, the analyst extends the time horizon of analysis so that the lives of both projects will divide exactly into the horizon. The projects are replicated over this horizon, and the NPV for the total cash flows over the least common multiple of lives is used to evaluate the investments. The equivalent annual annuity is the annuity payment (series of equal annual payments over the project’s life) that is equivalent in value to the project’s actual cash flows. Analysts find the present value of all of the cash flows for an investment (the NPV) and then calculate an annuity payment that has a value equivalent to the NPV. With capital rationing, the company’s capital budget has a size constraint. Under “hard” capital rationing, the budget is fixed. In the case of hard rationing, managers use trial and error and sometimes mathematical programming to find the optimal set of projects. In that situation, it is best to use the NPV or PI valuation methods. Sensitivity analysis calculates the effect on the NPV of changes in one input variable at a time. Scenario analysis creates scenarios that consist of changes in several of the input variables and calculates the NPV for each scenario. Simulation (Monte Carlo) analysis is used to estimate probability distributions for the NPV or IRR of a capital project. Simulations randomly select values for stochastic input variables and then repeatedly calculate the project NPV and IRR to find their distributions. Real options can be classified as 1) timing options; 2) sizing options, which can be abandonment options or growth (expansion) options; 3) flexibility options, which can be price-setting options or production-flexibility options; and 4) fundamental options.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/arbitrage-free-valuation-framework.pdf,Fixed Income,2021,Level II,"The idea that market prices will adjust until there are no opportunities for arbitrage underpins the valuation of fixed-income securities, derivatives, and other financial assets. It is as intuitive as it is well-known. For a given investment, if the net proceeds are zero (e.g., buying and selling the same dollar amount of stocks) and the risk is zero, the return should be zero. Valuation tools must produce a value that is arbitrage free. The purpose of this reading is to develop a set of valuation tools for bonds that are consistent with this notion. The reading is organized around the learning objectives. After this brief introduction, Section 2 defines an arbitrage opportunity and discusses the implications of no arbitrage for the valuation of fixed-income securities. Section 3 presents some essential ideas and tools from yield curve analysis needed to introduce the binomial interest rate tree. In this section, the binomial interest rate tree framework is developed and used to value an option-free bond. The process used to calibrate the interest rate tree to match the current yield curve is introduced. This step ensures that the interest rate tree is consistent with pricing using the zero-coupon (i.e., spot) curve. The final topic presented in the section is an introduction of pathwise valuation. Section 4 describes a Monte Carlo forward-rate simulation and its application. A summary of the major results is given in Section 5.","The member should be able to: explain what is meant by arbitrage-free valuation of a fixed-income instrument; calculate the arbitrage-free value of an option-free, fixed-rate coupon bond; describe a binomial interest rate tree framework; describe the backward induction valuation methodology and calculate the value of a fixed-income instrument given its cash flow at each node; describe the process of calibrating a binomial interest rate tree to match a specific term structure; compare pricing using the zero-coupon yield curve with pricing using an arbitrage-free binomial lattice; describe pathwise valuation in a binomial interest rate framework and calculate the value of a fixed-income instrument given its cash flows along each path; describe a Monte Carlo forward-rate simulation and its application.","This reading presents the principles and tools for arbitrage valuation of fixed-income securities. Much of the discussion centers on the binomial interest rate tree, which can be used extensively to value both option-free bonds and bonds with embedded options. The following are the main points made in the reading: A fundamental principle of valuation is that the value of any financial asset is equal to the present value of its expected future cash flows. A fixed-income security is a portfolio of zero-coupon bonds. Each zero-coupon bond has its own discount rate that depends on the shape of the yield curve and when the cash flow is delivered in time. In well-functioning markets, prices adjust until there are no opportunities for arbitrage. The law of one price states that two goods that are perfect substitutes must sell for the same current price in the absence of transaction costs. An arbitrage opportunity is a transaction that involves no cash outlay yet results in a riskless profit. Using the arbitrage-free approach, viewing a security as a package of zero-coupon bonds means that two bonds with the same maturity and different coupon rates are viewed as different packages of zero-coupon bonds and valued accordingly. For bonds that are option free, an arbitrage-free value is simply the present value of expected future values using the benchmark spot rates. A binomial interest rate tree permits the short interest rate to take on one of two possible values consistent with the volatility assumption and an interest rate model. An interest rate tree is a visual representation of the possible values of interest rates (forward rates) based on an interest rate model and an assumption about interest rate volatility. The possible interest rates for any following period are consistent with the following three assumptions: (1) an interest rate model that governs the random process of interest rates, (2) the assumed level of interest rate volatility, and (3) the current benchmark yield curve. From the lognormal distribution, adjacent interest rates on the tree are multiples of e raised to the 2σ power. One of the benefits of a lognormal distribution is that if interest rates get too close to zero, then the absolute change in interest rates becomes smaller and smaller. We use the backward induction valuation methodology that involves starting at maturity, filling in those values, and working back from right to left to find the bond’s value at the desired node. The interest rate tree is fit to the current yield curve by choosing interest rates that result in the benchmark bond value. By doing this, the bond value is arbitrage free. An option-free bond that is valued by using the binomial interest rate tree should have the same value as discounting by the spot rates. Pathwise valuation calculates the present value of a bond for each possible interest rate path and takes the average of these values across paths. The Monte Carlo method is an alternative method for simulating a sufficiently large number of potential interest rate paths in an effort to discover how the value of a security is affected and involves randomly selecting paths in an effort to approximate the results of a complete pathwise valuation.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/analysis-dividends-share-repurchases.pdf,Corporate Finance,2021,Level II,"This reading covers the features and characteristics of dividends and share repurchases as well as the theory and practice of corporate payout policy. A dividend is a distribution paid to shareholders. Dividends are declared (i.e., authorized) by a corporation’s board of directors, whose actions may require approval by shareholders (e.g., in most of Europe) or may not require such approval (e.g., in the United States). Shares trading ex-dividend refers to shares that no longer carry the right to the next dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is the first date that a share trades without (i.e., “ex”) this right to receive the declared dividend for the period. All else holding constant, on the ex-dividend date the share price can be expected to drop by the amount of the dividend. In contrast to the payment of interest and principal on a bond by its issuer, the payment of dividends is discretionary rather than a legal obligation and may be limited in amount by legal statutes and debt contract provisions. Dividend payments and interest payments in many jurisdictions are subject to different tax treatment at both the corporate and personal levels. In this reading, we focus on dividends on common shares (as opposed to preferred shares) paid by publicly traded companies. A company’s payout policy is the set of principles guiding cash dividends and the value of shares repurchased in any given year. Payout policy (also called distribution policy) is more general than dividend policy because it reflects the fact that companies can return cash to shareholders by means of share repurchases and cash dividends. One of the longest running debates in corporate finance concerns the impact of a company’s payout policy on common shareholders’ wealth. Payout decisions, along with financing (capital structure) decisions, generally involve the board of directors and senior management and are closely watched by investors and analysts. Dividends and share repurchases concern analysts because, as distributions to shareholders, they affect investment returns and financial ratios. The contribution of dividends to total return for stocks is formidable. For example, the total compound annual return for the S&P 500 Index with dividends reinvested from the beginning of 1926 to the end of 2018 was 10.0%, as compared with 5.9% on the basis of price alone. Similarly, from 1950 to 2018 the total compound annual return for the Nikkei 225 Index with dividends reinvested was 11.1%, as compared with 8.0% on the basis of price alone. Dividends also may provide important information about future company performance and investment returns. Analysts should strive to become familiar with all investment-relevant aspects of dividends and share repurchases. This reading is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the features and characteristics of cash dividends, liquidating dividends, stock dividends, stock splits, and reverse stock splits and describes their expected effect on shareholders’ wealth and a company’s financial ratios. Section 3 presents theories of the effects of dividend policy on company value. In Section 4, we discuss factors that affect dividend policy in practice. In Section 5, we cover three major types of dividend policies. Section 6 presents share repurchases, including their income statement and balance sheet effects and equivalence to cash dividends (under certain assumptions). Section 7 presents global trends in payout policy. Section 8 covers analysis of dividend safety. The reading concludes with a summary.","The member should be able to: describe the expected effect of regular cash dividends, extra dividends, liquidating dividends, stock dividends, stock splits, and reverse stock splits on shareholders’ wealth and a company’s financial ratios; compare theories of dividend policy and explain implications of each for share value given a description of a corporate dividend action; describe types of information (signals) that dividend initiations, increases, decreases, and omissions may convey; explain how agency costs may affect a company’s payout policy; explain factors that affect dividend policy in practice; calculate and interpret the effective tax rate on a given currency unit of corporate earnings under double taxation, dividend imputation, and split-rate tax systems; compare stable dividend with constant dividend payout ratio, and calculate the dividend under each policy; compare share repurchase methods; calculate and compare the effect of a share repurchase on earnings per share when 1) the repurchase is financed with the company’s surplus cash and 2) the company uses debt to finance the repurchase; calculate the effect of a share repurchase on book value per share; explain the choice between paying cash dividends and repurchasing shares; describe broad trends in corporate payout policies; calculate and interpret dividend coverage ratios based on 1) net income and 2) free cash flow; identify characteristics of companies that may not be able to sustain their cash dividend.","A company’s cash dividend payment and share repurchase policies constitute its payout policy. Both entail the distribution of the company’s cash to its shareholders affect the form in which shareholders receive the return on their investment. Among the points this reading has made are the following: Dividends can take the form of regular or irregular cash payments, stock dividends, or stock splits. Only cash dividends are payments to shareholders. Stock dividends and splits merely carve equity into smaller pieces and do not create wealth for shareholders. Reverse stock splits usually occur after a stock has dropped to a very low price and do not affect shareholder wealth. Regular cash dividends—unlike irregular cash dividends, stock splits, and stock dividends—represent a commitment to pay cash to stockholders on a quarterly, semiannual, or annual basis. There are three general theories on investor preference for dividends. The first, MM, argues that given perfect markets dividend policy is irrelevant. The second, “bird in hand” theory, contends that investors value a dollar of dividends today more than uncertain capital gains in the future. The third theory argues that in countries in which dividends are taxed at higher rates than capital gains, taxable investors prefer that companies reinvest earnings in profitable growth opportunities or repurchase shares so they receive more of the return in the form of capital gains. An argument for dividend irrelevance given perfect markets is that corporate dividend policy is irrelevant because shareholders can create their preferred cash flow stream by selling the company’s shares (“homemade dividends”). Dividend declarations may provide information to current and prospective shareholders regarding management’s confidence in the prospects of the company. Initiating a dividend or increasing a dividend sends a positive signal, whereas cutting a dividend or omitting a dividend typically sends a negative signal. In addition, some institutional and individual shareholders see regular cash dividend payments as a measure of investment quality. Payment of dividends can help reduce the agency conflicts between managers and shareholders, but it also can worsen conflicts of interest between shareholders and debtholders. Empirically, several factors appear to influence dividend policy, including investment opportunities for the company, the volatility expected in its future earnings, financial flexibility, tax considerations, flotation costs, and contractual and legal restrictions. Under double taxation systems, dividends are taxed at both the corporate and shareholder level. Under tax imputation systems, a shareholder receives a tax credit on dividends for the tax paid on corporate profits. Under split-rate taxation systems, corporate profits are taxed at different rates depending on whether the profits are retained or paid out in dividends. Companies with outstanding debt often are restricted in the amount of dividends they can pay because of debt covenants and legal restrictions. Some institutions require that a company pay a dividend to be on their “approved” investment list. If a company funds capital expenditures by borrowing while paying earnings out in dividends, it will incur flotation costs on new debt issues. Using a stable dividend policy, a company tries to align its dividend growth rate to the company’s long-term earnings growth rate. Dividends may increase even in years when earnings decline, and dividends will increase at a lower rate than earnings in boom years. A stable dividend policy can be represented by a gradual adjustment process in which the expected dividend is equal to last year’s dividend per share plus [(Expected earnings × Target payout ratio − Previous dividend) × Adjustment factor]. Using a constant dividend payout ratio policy, a company applies a target dividend payout ratio to current earnings; therefore, dividends are more volatile than with a stable dividend policy. Share repurchases, or buybacks, most often occur in the open market. Alternatively, tender offers occur at a fixed price or at a price range through a Dutch auction. Shareholders who do not tender increase their relative position in the company. Direct negotiations with major shareholders to get them to sell their positions are less common because they could destroy value for remaining stockholders. Share repurchases made with excess cash have the potential to increase earnings per share, whereas share repurchases made with borrowed funds can increase, decrease, or not affect earnings per share depending on the company’s after-tax borrowing rate and earnings yield. A share repurchase is equivalent to the payment of a cash dividend of equal amount in its effect on total shareholders’ wealth, all other things being equal. If the buyback market price per share is greater (less) than the book value per share, then the book value per share will decrease (increase). Companies can repurchase shares in lieu of increasing cash dividends. Share repurchases usually offer company management more flexibility than cash dividends by not establishing the expectation that a particular level of cash distribution will be maintained. Companies can pay regular cash dividends supplemented by share repurchases. In years of extraordinary increases in earnings, share repurchases can substitute for special cash dividends. On the one hand, share repurchases can signal that company officials think their shares are undervalued. On the other hand, share repurchases could send a negative signal that the company has few positive NPV opportunities. Analysts are interested in how safe a company’s dividend is, specifically whether the company’s earnings and, more importantly, its cash flow are sufficient to sustain the payment of the dividend. Early warning signs of whether a company can sustain its dividend include the dividend coverage ratio, the level of dividend yield, whether the company borrows to pay the dividend, and the company’s past dividend record.

Investment professionals and firms that undertake and perform their responsibilities with honesty and integrity are critical to maintaining investors’ trust and confidence and to upholding the client covenant of trust, loyalty, prudence, and care. CFA Institute and its members are committed to reinforcing those principles. The CFA Institute mission is to lead the investment profession globally by setting the highest standards of ethics, education, and professional excellence. To foster this culture of ethics and professionalism, CFA Institute offers this voluntary code of conduct. It is designed to be broadly adopted within the industry as a template and guidepost for investors seeking managers who adhere to sound ethical practice. The Asset Manager Code of Professional Conduct outlines the ethical and professional responsibilities of firms that manage assets on behalf of clients. Whereas the CFA Institute Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct address individual conduct, this Code is meant to apply, on a global basis, to firms that manage client assets as separate accounts or pooled funds (including collective investment schemes, mutual funds, and fund of funds organizations); we refer to such firms as “Managers.” In part, this document responds to requests from Managers to extend the scope of the Code and Standards to the firm level. Although many institutional asset managers, particularly those in well-regulated jurisdictions, already have such a code in place, they should use this Code to evaluate their own code and ensure that all of this Code’s principles have been included. This Code also has been developed for use by asset managers, including hedge fund managers, who may not already have such a code in place. This second edition of the Code includes provisions relating to risk management as well as guidance for Managers seeking to claim compliance. Ethical leadership begins at the highest level of an organization; therefore, the Code should be adopted by the Manager’s senior management, board of directors, and similar oversight bodies. Such adoption sends a strong message regarding the importance of ethical behavior at the firm. Rather than creating rules that apply only to certain people or groups, this Code is intended to cover all employees of the firm. Although not every employee is actively involved in conduct covered in the Code, a code that is broadly applied reinforces the need for all employees to understand the ethical issues involved in the asset management business. By adopting and enforcing a code of conduct for their organizations, Managers demonstrate their commitment to ethical behavior and the protection of investors’ interests. In doing so, the Managers also protect and enhance the reputation of their organizations. The Code sets forth minimum ethical standards for providing asset management services for clients. It is meant to be general in nature and allows flexibility for asset managers of various sizes and structures to develop the particular policies and procedures necessary to implement the Code. The goal of this Code is to set forth a useful framework for all asset managers to provide services in a fair and professional manner and to fully disclose key elements of those services to clients, regardless of whether individual Managers are required to register or comply with applicable securities laws or regulations. Unregistered hedge fund managers, in particular, are encouraged to adopt the Code and implement its provisions to ensure fair dealing and integrity and to promote self-regulation in this dynamic sector. We recognize that in the highly regulated and complex business of investment management, the adoption of a code of ethics by itself is not sufficient to ensure ethical conduct. To be implemented effectively, the principles and standards embodied in the Code must be supported by appropriate compliance procedures. The specific procedures that translate principle into practice will depend on a variety of factors, including the business of the Manager, the type of clients, the size of the Manager (based on assets under management and on number of employees), the regulatory régime with which the Manager must comply, and other factors. Managers must adhere to all applicable laws and regulations governing their activities. Thus, the provisions of this Code may need to be supplemented with additional provisions to meet the requirements of applicable security regulation in markets around the world. Inevitably, in some markets, the Code will closely reflect or be aligned with existing regulation or accepted best practice and in other markets, the Code will expand on the existing work of regulatory authorities or may even break new ground. Furthermore, Managers operate in different types of market structures, which may affect the manner in which the Code can be applied. Despite these differences, the Code provides a universal set of principles and standards relevant to all asset managers. Clients have a responsibility to be aware of, understand, and monitor how their assets are invested. Yet, to fulfill this responsibility, clients must be able to count on full and fair disclosure from their Managers. Providing clients with a code of ethics that sets a framework for how the Manager conducts business is an important step toward developing the trust and confidence necessary for a successful investment management relationship. Adopting the Code and Claiming Compliance Adoption of or compliance with the Asset Manager Code of Professional Conduct requires firms to adhere to all the principles of conduct and provisions set forth in the Code. Many asset management firms already have codes of ethics and other policies and procedures that address or go beyond the principles and provisions of the Code. Adoption of or compliance with the Code does not require a firm to amend its existing code of ethics or other policies and procedures as long as they are at least consistent with the principles and provisions set forth in the Code. Managers are strongly encouraged to review and consider the material in the Appendix when developing and reviewing their codes and other policies and procedures, although because of the many variables in size and complexity among asset management firms, compliance with the Code does not require strict adherence to this guidance. If the Manager has not complied with each of the principles of conduct and provisions of the Code, the Manager cannot represent that it is in compliance with the Code. Statements referring to partial or incomplete compliance (e.g., “the firm complies with the Asset Manager Code except for . . .” or “the firm complies with parts A, B, and C of the Asset Manager Code”) are prohibited. Once a Manager has met each of the required elements of the Code, the firm must make the following statement whenever the firm claims compliance with the Code: “[Insert name of Firm] claims compliance with the CFA Institute Asset Manager Code of Professional Conduct. This claim has not been verified by CFA Institute.” Acknowledgement of Claim of Compliance to CFA Institute Asset managers must notify CFA Institute of their claim of compliance with the Asset Manager Code of Professional Conduct through the CFA Institute online notification process at www.cfainstitute.org/assetcode . Asset managers must submit this notification when they initially claim compliance and on an annual basis thereafter. This acknowledgement form is for communication and information-gathering purposes only and does not represent that CFA Institute engages in enforcement or quality control of an organization’s claim of compliance. CFA Institute does not verify either the asset manager’s claim of compliance or actual compliance with the Code.","The member should be able to: explain the purpose of the Asset Manager Code and the benefits that may accrue to a firm that adopts the Code; explain the ethical and professional responsibilities required by the six General Principles of Conduct of the Asset Manager Code; determine whether an asset manager’s practices and procedures are consistent with the Asset Manager Code; recommend practices and procedures designed to prevent violations of the Asset Manager Code.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/capital-structure.pdf,Corporate Finance,2021,Level II,"The most important decision a company makes in pursuit of maximizing its value is typically the decision concerning what products to manufacture and/or what services to offer. The decision on how to finance investments (e.g., in factories and equipment), the so-called capital structure decision, is often seen as less important, even secondary. As we will see in this reading, the importance of the capital structure decision depends on the assumptions one makes about capital markets and the agents operating in it. Under the most restrictive set of assumptions, the capital structure decision—the choice between how much debt and how much equity a company uses in financing its investments—is irrelevant. That is, any level of debt is as good as any other. The capital structure decision is not only secondary but also irrelevant. However, as some of the underlying assumptions are relaxed, the choice of how much debt to have in the capital structure becomes meaningful. Under a particular set of assumptions, it is even possible to have an optimal level of debt in the capital structure—that is, a level of debt at which company value is maximized. In this reading, we first discuss the capital structure decision and the assumptions and theories that lead to alternative capital structures. We then present important practical issues for the analyst, such as differences in capital structure policies arising from country-specific factors. We conclude with a summary of key points from the reading.","The member should be able to: explain the Modigliani–Miller propositions regarding capital structure; explain the effects on costs of capital and capital structure decisions of taxes, financial distress, agency costs, and asymmetric information; explain factors an analyst should consider in evaluating the effect of capital structure policy on valuation; describe international differences in the use of financial leverage, factors that explain these differences, and implications of these differences for investment analysis.","In this reading, we have reviewed theories of capital structure and considered practical aspects that an analyst should examine when making investment decisions. The goal of the capital structure decision is to determine the financial leverage that maximizes the value of the company (or minimizes the weighted average cost of capital). In the Modigliani and Miller theory developed without taxes, capital structure is irrelevant and has no effect on company value. The deductibility of interest lowers the cost of debt and the cost of capital for the company as a whole. Adding the tax shield provided by debt to the Modigliani and Miller framework suggests that the optimal capital structure is all debt. In the Modigliani and Miller propositions with and without taxes, increasing a company’s relative use of debt in the capital structure increases the risk for equity providers and, hence, the cost of equity capital. When there are bankruptcy costs, a high debt ratio increases the risk of bankruptcy. Using more debt in a company’s capital structure reduces the net agency costs of equity. The costs of asymmetric information increase as more equity is used versus debt, suggesting the pecking order theory of leverage in which new equity issuance is the least preferred method of raising capital. According to the static trade-off theory of capital structure, in choosing a capital structure, a company balances the value of the tax benefit from deductibility of interest with the present value of the costs of financial distress. At the optimal target capital structure, the incremental tax shield benefit is exactly offset by the incremental costs of financial distress. A company may identify its target capital structure, but its capital structure at any point in time may not be equal to its target for many reasons. Many companies have goals for maintaining a certain credit rating, and these goals are influenced by the relative costs of debt financing among the different rating classes. In evaluating a company’s capital structure, the financial analyst must look at such factors as the capital structure of the company over time, the business risk of the company, the capital structure of competitors that have similar business risk, and company-specific factors (e.g., the quality of corporate governance, which may affect agency costs). Good corporate governance and accounting transparency should lower the net agency costs of equity. When comparing capital structures of companies in different countries, an analyst must consider a variety of characteristics that might differ and affect both the typical capital structure and the debt maturity structure. The major characteristics fall into three categories: institutional and legal environment, financial markets and banking sector, and macroeconomic environment.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/basics-derivative-pricing-valuation.pdf,Derivatives,2021,Level I,"It is important to understand how prices of derivatives are determined. Whether one is on the buy side or the sell side, a solid understanding of pricing financial products is critical to effective investment decision making. After all, one can hardly determine what to offer or bid for a financial product, or any product for that matter, if one has no idea how its characteristics combine to create value. Understanding the pricing of financial assets is important. Discounted cash flow methods and models, such as the capital asset pricing model and its variations, are useful for determining the prices of financial assets. The unique characteristics of derivatives, however, pose some complexities not associated with assets, such as equities and fixed-income instruments. Somewhat surprisingly, however, derivatives also have some simplifying characteristics. For example, as we will see in this reading, in well-functioning derivatives markets the need to determine risk premiums is obviated by the ability to construct a risk-free hedge. Correspondingly, the need to determine an investor’s risk aversion is irrelevant for derivative pricing, although it is certainly relevant for pricing the underlying. The purpose of this reading is to establish the foundations of derivative pricing on a basic conceptual level. The following topics are covered: How does the pricing of the underlying asset affect the pricing of derivatives? How are derivatives priced using the principle of arbitrage? How are the prices and values of forward contracts determined? How are futures contracts priced differently from forward contracts? How are the prices and values of swaps determined? How are the prices and values of European options determined? How does American option pricing differ from European option pricing? This reading is organized as follows. Section 2 explores two related topics, the pricing of the underlying assets on which derivatives are created and the principle of arbitrage. Section 3 describes the pricing and valuation of forwards, futures, and swaps. Section 4 introduces the pricing and valuation of options. Section 5 provides a summary.","The member should be able to: explain how the concepts of arbitrage, replication, and risk neutrality are used in pricing derivatives; distinguish between value and price of forward and futures contracts; calculate a forward price of an asset with zero, positive, or negative net cost of carry; explain how the value and price of a forward contract are determined at expiration, during the life of the contract, and at initiation; describe monetary and nonmonetary benefits and costs associated with holding the underlying asset and explain how they affect the value and price of a forward contract; define a forward rate agreement and describe its uses; explain why forward and futures prices differ; explain how swap contracts are similar to but different from a series of forward contracts; distinguish between the value and price of swaps; explain the exercise value, time value, and moneyness of an option; identify the factors that determine the value of an option and explain how each factor affects the value of an option; explain put–call parity for European options; explain put–call–forward parity for European options; explain how the value of an option is determined using a one-period binomial model; explain under which circumstances the values of European and American options differ.","This reading on derivative pricing provides a foundation for understanding how derivatives are valued and traded. Key points include the following: The price of the underlying asset is equal to the expected future price discounted at the risk-free rate, plus a risk premium, plus the present value of any benefits, minus the present value of any costs associated with holding the asset. An arbitrage opportunity occurs when two identical assets or combinations of assets sell at different prices, leading to the possibility of buying the cheaper asset and selling the more expensive asset to produce a risk-free return without investing any capital. In well-functioning markets, arbitrage opportunities are quickly exploited, and the resulting increased buying of underpriced assets and increased selling of overpriced assets returns prices to equivalence. Derivatives are priced by creating a risk-free combination of the underlying and a derivative, leading to a unique derivative price that eliminates any possibility of arbitrage. Derivative pricing through arbitrage precludes any need for determining risk premiums or the risk aversion of the party trading the option and is referred to as risk-neutral pricing. The value of a forward contract at expiration is the value of the asset minus the forward price. The value of a forward contract prior to expiration is the value of the asset minus the present value of the forward price. The forward price, established when the contract is initiated, is the price agreed to by the two parties that produces a zero value at the start. Costs incurred and benefits received by holding the underlying affect the forward price by raising and lowering it, respectively. Futures prices can differ from forward prices because of the effect of interest rates on the interim cash flows from the daily settlement. Swaps can be priced as an implicit series of off-market forward contracts, whereby each contract is priced the same, resulting in some contracts being positively valued and some negatively valued but with their combined value equaling zero. At expiration, a European call or put is worth its exercise value, which for calls is the greater of zero or the underlying price minus the exercise price and for puts is the greater of zero and the exercise price minus the underlying price. European calls and puts are affected by the value of the underlying, the exercise price, the risk-free rate, the time to expiration, the volatility of the underlying, and any costs incurred or benefits received while holding the underlying. Option values experience time value decay, which is the loss in value due to the passage of time and the approach of expiration, plus the moneyness and the volatility. The minimum value of a European call is the maximum of zero and the underlying price minus the present value of the exercise price. The minimum value of a European put is the maximum of zero and the present value of the exercise price minus the price of the underlying. European put and call prices are related through put–call parity, which specifies that the put price plus the price of the underlying equals the call price plus the present value of the exercise price. European put and call prices are related through put–call–forward parity, which shows that the put price plus the value of a risk-free bond with face value equal to the forward price equals the call price plus the value of a risk-free bond with face value equal to the exercise price. The values of European options can be obtained using the binomial model, which specifies two possible prices of the asset one period later and enables the construction of a risk-free hedge consisting of the option and the underlying. American call prices can differ from European call prices only if there are cash flows on the underlying, such as dividends or interest; these cash flows are the only reason for early exercise of a call. American put prices can differ from European put prices, because the right to exercise early always has value for a put, which is because of a lower limit on the value of the underlying.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/analysis-active-portfolio-management.pdf,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,2021,Level II,"The Markowitz (1952) framework of what was originally called modern portfolio theory (MPT) has now become the prominent paradigm for communicating and applying principles of risk and return in portfolio management. Much of the mathematics and terminology of mean–variance portfolio theory was subsequently combined with the notion of informational efficiency by Sharpe (1964) and other financial economists to develop equilibrium models, such as the traditional capital asset pricing model. Separately, the tools of MPT were applied by Treynor and Black (1973) to guide investors in their selection of securities when prices differ from their equilibrium values. The application of portfolio theory to active management was further developed by Grinold (1989) in “The Fundamental Law of Active Management” and by Black and Litterman (1992). We summarize the principles of active portfolio management using the terminology and mathematics of the fundamental law introduced by Grinold (1989) and further developed by Clarke, de Silva, and Thorley (2002). Active management theory deals with how an investor should construct a portfolio given an assumed competitive advantage or skill in predicting returns. Thus, active management relies on the assumption that financial markets are not perfectly efficient. Although investors might ultimately care about total risk and return, when asset management is delegated to professional investors in institutional settings (e.g., pension funds) the appropriate perspective is risk and return relative to a benchmark portfolio. In addition to the principal–agent problem in delegated asset management, the availability of passively managed portfolios requires a focus on value added above and beyond the alternative of a low-cost index fund. We assume an understanding of basic portfolio theory, including the mathematics of expected values, variances, and correlation coefficients, as well as some familiarity with the related disciplines of mean–variance optimization and multi-factor risk models. The following sections introduce the mathematics of value added through active portfolio management, including the concepts of active weights, relative returns, and performance attribution systems. The subsequent section compares the well-known Sharpe ratio for measuring the total risk-adjusted value added with the information ratio for measuring relative risk-adjusted value added. This section also makes a distinction between ex ante , or expected, risk and return versus ex post , or realized, risk and return and explains that the information ratio is the best criterion for evaluating active investors. We then introduce the fundamental law that describes how relative skill, breadth of application, active management aggressiveness, and the constraints in portfolio construction combine to affect value added. The remaining sections provide examples of active portfolio management strategies in both the equity and fixed-income markets, describe some of the practical limitations of the fundamental law, and provide a summary of the concepts and principles.","The member should be able to: describe how value added by active management is measured; calculate and interpret the information ratio ( ex post and ex ante ) and contrast it to the Sharpe ratio; state and interpret the fundamental law of active portfolio management, including its component terms—transfer coefficient, information coefficient, breadth, and active risk (aggressiveness); explain how the information ratio may be useful in investment manager selection and choosing the level of active portfolio risk; compare active management strategies, including market timing and security selection, and evaluate strategy changes in terms of the fundamental law of active management; describe the practical strengths and limitations of the fundamental law of active management.","We have covered a number of key concepts and principles associated with active portfolio management. Active management is based on the mathematics and principles of risk and return from basic mean–variance portfolio theory but with a focus on value added compared with a benchmark portfolio. Critical concepts include the following: Value added is defined as the difference between the return on the managed portfolio and the return on a passive benchmark portfolio. This difference in returns might be positive or negative after the fact but would be expected to be positive before the fact or active management would not be justified. Value added is related to active weights in the portfolio, defined as differences between the various asset weights in the managed portfolio and their weights in the benchmark portfolio. Individual assets can be overweighted (have positive active weights) or underweighted (have negative active weights), but the complete set of active weights sums to zero. Positive value added is generated when positive-active-weight assets have larger returns than negative-active-weight assets. By defining individual asset active returns as the difference between the asset total return and the benchmark return, value added is shown to be positive if and only if end-of-period realized active asset returns are positively correlated with the active asset weights established at the beginning of the period. Value added can come from a variety of active portfolio management decisions, including security selection, asset class allocation, and even further decompositions into economic sector weightings and geographic or country weights. The Sharpe ratio measures reward per unit of risk in absolute returns, whereas the information ratio measures reward per unit of risk in benchmark relative returns. Either ratio can be applied ex ante to expected returns or ex post to realized returns. The information ratio is a key criterion on which to evaluate actively managed portfolios. Higher information ratio portfolios can be used to create higher Sharpe ratio portfolios. The optimal amount of active management that maximizes a portfolio’s Sharpe ratio is positively related to the assumed forecasting accuracy or ex ante information coefficient of the active strategy. The active risk of an actively managed strategy can be adjusted to its desired level by combining it with a position in the benchmark. Furthermore, once an investor has identified the maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio, the total volatility of a portfolio can be adjusted to its desired level by combining it with cash (two-fund separation concept). The fundamental law of active portfolio management began as a conceptual framework for evaluating the potential value added of various investment strategies, but it has also emerged as an operational system for measuring the essential components of those active strategies. Although the fundamental law provides a framework for analyzing investment strategies, the essential inputs of forecasted asset returns and risks still require judgment in formulating the expected returns. The fundamental law separates the expected value added, or portfolio return relative to the benchmark return, into the basic elements of the strategy: skill as measured by the information coefficient, structuring of the portfolio as measured by the transfer coefficient, breadth of the strategy measured by the number of independent decisions per year, and aggressiveness measured by the benchmark tracking risk. The last three of these four elements may be beyond the control of the investor if they are specified by investment policy or constrained by regulation. The fundamental law has been applied in settings that include the selection of country equity markets in a global equity fund and the timing of credit and duration exposures in a fixed-income fund. The fundamental law of active management has limitations, including uncertainty about the ex ante information coefficient and the conceptual definition of breadth as the number of independent decisions by the investor.

It addresses adaptations to the asset allocation inputs given an asset owner’s asset size, liquidity, and time horizon as well as external constraints that may affect the asset allocation choice (Section 2). We also discuss the ways in which taxes influence the asset allocation process for the taxable investor (Section 3). In addition, we discuss the circumstances that should trigger a re-evaluation of the long-term strategic asset allocation (Section 4), when and how an asset owner might want to make short-term shifts in asset allocation (Section 5), and how innate investor behaviors can interfere with successful long-term planning for the investment portfolio (Section 6). Throughout the reading, we illustrate the application of these concepts using a series of hypothetical investors.","The member should be able to: discuss asset size, liquidity needs, time horizon, and regulatory or other considerations as constraints on asset allocation; discuss tax considerations in asset allocation and rebalancing; recommend and justify revisions to an asset allocation given change(s) in investment objectives and/or constraints; discuss the use of short-term shifts in asset allocation; identify behavioral biases that arise in asset allocation and recommend methods to overcome them.","The primary constraints on an asset allocation decision are asset size, liquidity, time horizon, and other external considerations, such as taxes and regulation. The size of an asset owner’s portfolio may limit the asset classes accessible to the asset owner. An asset owner’s portfolio may be too small—or too large—to capture the returns of certain asset classes or strategies efficiently. Complex asset classes and investment vehicles require sufficient governance capacity. Large-scale asset owners may achieve operating efficiencies, but they may find it difficult to deploy capital effectively in certain active investment strategies given liquidity conditions and trading costs. Smaller portfolios may also be constrained by size. They may be too small to adequately diversify across the range of asset classes and investment managers, or they may have staffing constraints that prevent them from monitoring a complex investment program. Investors with smaller portfolios may be constrained in their ability to access private equity, private real estate, hedge funds, and infrastructure investments because of the high required minimum investments and regulatory restrictions associated with those asset classes. Wealthy families may pool assets to meet the required minimums. The liquidity needs of the asset owner and the liquidity characteristics of the asset classes each influence the available opportunity set. Liquidity needs must also take into consideration the financial strength of the investor and resources beyond those held in the investment portfolio. When assessing the appropriateness of any given asset class for a given investor, it is important to evaluate potential liquidity needs in the context of an extreme market stress event. An investor’s time horizon must be considered in any asset allocation exercise. Changes in human capital and the changing character of liabilities are two important time-related constraints of asset allocation. External considerations—such as regulations, tax rules, funding, and financing needs—are also likely to influence the asset allocation decision. Taxes alter the distribution of returns by both reducing the expected mean return and muting the dispersion of returns. Asset values and asset risk and return inputs to asset allocation should be modified to reflect the tax status of the investor. Correlation assumptions do not need to be adjusted, but taxes do affect the return and the standard deviation assumptions for each asset class. Periodic portfolio rebalancing to return the portfolio to its target strategic asset allocation is an integral part of sound portfolio management. Taxable investors must consider the tax implications of rebalancing. Rebalancing thresholds may be wider for taxable portfolios because it takes larger asset class movements to materially alter the risk profile of the taxable portfolio. Strategic asset location is the placement of less tax-efficient assets in accounts with more-favorable tax treatment. An asset owner’s strategic asset allocation should be re-examined periodically, even in the absence of a change in the asset owner’s circumstances. A special review of the asset allocation policy may be triggered by a change in goals, constraints, or beliefs. In some situations, a change to an asset allocation strategy may be implemented without a formal asset allocation study. Anticipating key milestones that would alter the asset owner’s risk appetite, and implementing pre-established changes to the asset allocation in response, is often referred to as a “glide path.” Tactical asset allocation (TAA) allows short-term deviations from the strategic asset allocation (SAA) targets and are expected to increase risk-adjusted return. Using either short-term views or signals, the investor actively re-weights broad asset classes, sectors, or risk-factor premiums. The sizes of these deviations from the SAA are often constrained by the Investment Policy Statement. The success of TAA decisions is measured against the performance of the SAA policy portfolio by comparing Sharpe ratios, evaluating the information ratio or the t -statistic of the average excess return of the TAA portfolio relative to the SAA portfolio, or plotting outcomes versus the efficient frontier. TAA incurs trading and tax costs. Tactical trades can also increase the concentration of risk. Discretionary TAA relies on a qualitative interpretation of political, economic, and financial market conditions and is predicated on a belief of persistent manager skill in predicting and timing short-term market moves. Systematic TAA relies on quantitative signals to capture documented return anomalies that may be inconsistent with market efficiency. The behavioral biases most relevant in asset allocation include loss aversion, the illusion of control, mental accounting, recency bias, framing, and availability bias. An effective investment program will address behavioral biases through a formal asset allocation process with its own objective framework, governance, and controls. In goals-based investing, loss-aversion bias can be mitigated by framing risk in terms of shortfall probability or by funding high-priority goals with low-risk assets. The cognitive bias, illusion of control, and hindsight bias can all be mitigated by using a formal asset allocation process that uses long-term return and risk forecasts, optimization constraints anchored around asset class weights in the global market portfolio, and strict policy ranges. Goals-based investing incorporates the mental accounting bias directly into the asset allocation solution by aligning each goal with a discrete sub-portfolio. A formal asset allocation policy with pre-specified allowable ranges may constrain recency bias. The framing bias effect can be mitigated by presenting the possible asset allocation choices with multiple perspectives on the risk/reward trade-off. Familiarity bias, a form of availability bias, most commonly results in an overweight in home country securities and may also cause investors to inappropriately compare their investment decisions (and performance) to other organizations. Familiarity bias can be mitigated by using the global market portfolio as the starting point in developing the asset allocation and by carefully evaluating any potential deviations from this baseline portfolio. A strong governance framework with the appropriate level of expertise and well-documented investment beliefs increases the likelihood that shifts in asset allocation are made objectively and in accordance with those beliefs. This will help to mitigate the effect that behavioral biases may have on the long-term success of the investment program.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/common-probability-distributions.pdf,Quantitative Methods,2021,Level I,"In nearly all investment decisions we work with random variables. The return on a stock and its earnings per share are familiar examples of random variables. To make probability statements about a random variable, we need to understand its probability distribution. A probability distribution specifies the probabilities of the possible outcomes of a random variable. In this reading, we present important facts about four probability distributions and their investment uses. These four distributions—the uniform, binomial, normal, and lognormal—are used extensively in investment analysis. They are used in such basic valuation models as the Black–Scholes–Merton option pricing model, the binomial option pricing model, and the capital asset pricing model. With the working knowledge of probability distributions provided in this reading, you will also be better prepared to study and use other quantitative methods such as hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and time-series analysis. After discussing probability distributions, we end the reading with a brief introduction to Monte Carlo simulation, a computer-based tool for obtaining information on complex problems. For example, an investment analyst may want to experiment with an investment idea without actually implementing it. Or she may need to price a complex option for which no simple pricing formula exists. In these cases and many others, Monte Carlo simulation is an important resource. To conduct a Monte Carlo simulation, the analyst must identify risk factors associated with the problem and specify probability distributions for them. Hence, Monte Carlo simulation is a tool that requires an understanding of probability distributions. Before we discuss specific probability distributions, we define basic concepts and terms. We then illustrate the operation of these concepts through the simplest distribution, the uniform distribution. That done, we address probability distributions that have more applications in investment work but also greater complexity.","The member should be able to: define a probability distribution and distinguish between discrete and continuous random variables and their probability functions; describe the set of possible outcomes of a specified discrete random variable; interpret a cumulative distribution function; calculate and interpret probabilities for a random variable, given its cumulative distribution function; define a discrete uniform random variable, a Bernoulli random variable, and a binomial random variable; calculate and interpret probabilities given the discrete uniform and the binomial distribution functions; construct a binomial tree to describe stock price movement; define the continuous uniform distribution and calculate and interpret probabilities, given a continuous uniform distribution; explain the key properties of the normal distribution; distinguish between a univariate and a multivariate distribution and explain the role of correlation in the multivariate normal distribution; determine the probability that a normally distributed random variable lies inside a given interval; define the standard normal distribution, explain how to standardize a random variable, and calculate and interpret probabilities using the standard normal distribution; define shortfall risk, calculate the safety-first ratio, and select an optimal portfolio using Roy’s safety-first criterion; explain the relationship between normal and lognormal distributions and why the lognormal distribution is used to model asset prices; distinguish between discretely and continuously compounded rates of return and calculate and interpret a continuously compounded rate of return, given a specific holding period return; describe Monte Carlo simulation.","In this reading, we have presented the most frequently used probability distributions in investment analysis and the Monte Carlo simulation. A probability distribution specifies the probabilities of the possible outcomes of a random variable. The two basic types of random variables are discrete random variables and continuous random variables. Discrete random variables take on at most a countable number of possible outcomes that we can list as x 1 , x 2 , … In contrast, we cannot describe the possible outcomes of a continuous random variable Z with a list z 1 , z 2 , … because the outcome ( z 1 + z 2 )/2, not in the list, would always be possible. The probability function specifies the probability that the random variable will take on a specific value. The probability function is denoted p ( x ) for a discrete random variable and f ( x ) for a continuous random variable. For any probability function p ( x ), 0 ≤ p ( x ) ≤ 1, and the sum of p ( x ) over all values of X equals 1. The cumulative distribution function, denoted F ( x ) for both continuous and discrete random variables, gives the probability that the random variable is less than or equal to x . The discrete uniform and the continuous uniform distributions are the distributions of equally likely outcomes. The binomial random variable is defined as the number of successes in n Bernoulli trials, where the probability of success, p , is constant for all trials and the trials are independent. A Bernoulli trial is an experiment with two outcomes, which can represent success or failure, an up move or a down move, or another binary (two-fold) outcome. A binomial random variable has an expected value or mean equal to np and variance equal to np (1 − p ). A binomial tree is the graphical representation of a model of asset price dynamics in which, at each period, the asset moves up with probability p or down with probability (1 − p ). The binomial tree is a flexible method for modeling asset price movement and is widely used in pricing options. The normal distribution is a continuous symmetric probability distribution that is completely described by two parameters: its mean, μ, and its variance, σ 2 . A univariate distribution specifies the probabilities for a single random variable. A multivariate distribution specifies the probabilities for a group of related random variables. To specify the normal distribution for a portfolio when its component securities are normally distributed, we need the means, standard deviations, and all the distinct pairwise correlations of the securities. When we have those statistics, we have also specified a multivariate normal distribution for the securities. For a normal random variable, approximately 68 percent of all possible outcomes are within a one standard deviation interval about the mean, approximately 95 percent are within a two standard deviation interval about the mean, and approximately 99 percent are within a three standard deviation interval about the mean. A normal random variable, X , is standardized using the expression Z = ( X − μ)/σ, where μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of X. Generally, we use the sample mean X ¯ as an estimate of μ and the sample standard deviation s as an estimate of σ in this expression. The standard normal random variable, denoted Z , has a mean equal to 0 and variance equal to 1. All questions about any normal random variable can be answered by referring to the cumulative distribution function of a standard normal random variable, denoted N ( x ) or N ( z ). Shortfall risk is the risk that portfolio value will fall below some minimum acceptable level over some time horizon. Roy’s safety-first criterion, addressing shortfall risk, asserts that the optimal portfolio is the one that minimizes the probability that portfolio return falls below a threshold level. According to Roy’s safety-first criterion, if returns are normally distributed, the safety-first optimal portfolio P is the one that maximizes the quantity [ E ( R P ) − R L ]/σ P , where R L is the minimum acceptable level of return. A random variable follows a lognormal distribution if the natural logarithm of the random variable is normally distributed. The lognormal distribution is defined in terms of the mean and variance of its associated normal distribution. The lognormal distribution is bounded below by 0 and skewed to the right (it has a long right tail). The lognormal distribution is frequently used to model the probability distribution of asset prices because it is bounded below by zero. Continuous compounding views time as essentially continuous or unbroken; discrete compounding views time as advancing in discrete finite intervals. The continuously compounded return associated with a holding period is the natural log of 1 plus the holding period return, or equivalently, the natural log of ending price over beginning price. If continuously compounded returns are normally distributed, asset prices are lognormally distributed. This relationship is used to move back and forth between the distributions for return and price. Because of the central limit theorem, continuously compounded returns need not be normally distributed for asset prices to be reasonably well described by a lognormal distribution. Monte Carlo simulation involves the use of a computer to represent the operation of a complex financial system. A characteristic feature of Monte Carlo simulation is the generation of a large number of random samples from specified probability distribution(s) to represent the operation of risk in the system. Monte Carlo simulation is used in planning, in financial risk management, and in valuing complex securities. Monte Carlo simulation is a complement to analytical methods but provides only statistical estimates, not exact results.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/big-data-projects.pdf,Quantitative Methods,2021,Level II,"Big data (also referred to as alternative data) encompasses data generated by financial markets (e.g., stock and bond prices), businesses (e.g., company financials, production volumes), governments (e.g., economic and trade data), individuals (e.g., credit card purchases, social media posts), sensors (e.g., satellite imagery, traffic patterns), and the Internet of Things, or IoT, (i.e., the network of interrelated digital devices that can transfer data among themselves without human interaction). A veritable explosion in big data has occurred over the past decade or so, especially in unstructured data generated from social media (e.g., posts, tweets, blogs), email and text communications, web traffic, online news sites, electronic images, and other electronic information sources. The prospects are for exponential growth in big data to continue. Investment managers are increasingly using big data in their investment processes as they strive to discover signals embedded in such data that can provide them with an information edge. They seek to augment structured data with a plethora of unstructured data to develop improved forecasts of trends in asset prices, detect anomalies, etc. A typical example involves a fund manager using financial text data from 10-K reports for forecasting stock sentiment (i.e., positive or negative), which can then be used as an input to a more comprehensive forecasting model that includes corporate financial data. Unlike structured data (numbers and values) that can be readily organized into data tables to be read and analyzed by computers, unstructured data typically require specific methods of preparation and refinement before being usable by machines (i.e., computers) and useful to investment professionals. Given the volume, variety, and velocity of available big data, it is important for portfolio managers and investment analysts to have a basic understanding of how unstructured data can be transformed into structured data suitable as inputs to machine learning (ML) methods (in fact, for any type of modeling methods) that can potentially improve their financial forecasts. This reading describes the steps in using big data, both structured and unstructured, in financial forecasting. The concepts and methods are then demonstrated in a case study of an actual big data project. The project uses text-based data derived from financial documents to train an ML model to classify text into positive or negative sentiment classes for the respective stocks and then to predict sentiment. Section 2 of the reading covers a description of the key characteristics of big data. Section 3 provides an overview of the steps in executing a financial forecasting project using big data. We then describe in Sections 4–6 key aspects of data preparation and wrangling, data exploration, and model training using structured data and unstructured (textual) data. In Section 7, we bring these pieces together by covering the execution of an actual big data project. A summary in Section 8 concludes the reading.","The member should be able to: state and explain steps in a data analysis project; describe objectives, steps, and examples of preparing and wrangling data; describe objectives, methods, and examples of data exploration; describe objectives, steps, and techniques in model training; describe preparing, wrangling, and exploring text-based data for financial forecasting; describe methods for extracting, selecting and engineering features from textual data; evaluate the fit of a machine learning algorithm.","In this reading, we have discussed the major steps in big data projects involving the development of machine learning (ML) models—namely, those combining textual big data with structured inputs. Big data—defined as data with volume, velocity, variety, and potentially lower veracity—has tremendous potential for various fintech applications, including several related to investment management. The main steps for traditional ML model building are conceptualization of the problem, data collection, data preparation and wrangling, data exploration, and model training. For textual ML model building, the first four steps differ somewhat from those used in the traditional model: Text problem formulation, text curation, text preparation and wrangling, and text exploration are typically necessary. For structured data, data preparation and wrangling entail data cleansing and data preprocessing. Data cleansing typically involves resolving incompleteness errors, invalidity errors, inaccuracy errors, inconsistency errors, non-uniformity errors, and duplication errors. Preprocessing for structured data typically involves performing the following transformations: extraction, aggregation, filtration, selection, and conversion. Preparation and wrangling text (unstructured) data involves a set of text-specific cleansing and preprocessing tasks. Text cleansing typically involves removing the following: html tags, punctuations, most numbers, and white spaces. Text preprocessing requires performing normalization that involves the following: lowercasing, removing stop words, stemming, lemmatization, creating bag-of-words (BOW) and n-grams, and organizing the BOW and n-grams into a document term matrix (DTM). Data exploration encompasses exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and feature engineering. Whereas histograms, box plots, and scatterplots are common techniques for exploring structured data, word clouds are an effective way to gain a high-level picture of the composition of textual content. These visualization tools help share knowledge among the team (business subject matter experts, quants, technologists, etc.) to help derive optimal solutions. Feature selection methods used for text data include term frequency, document frequency, chi-square test, and a mutual information measure. Feature engineering for text data includes converting numbers into tokens, creating n-grams, and using name entity recognition and parts of speech to engineer new feature variables. The model training steps (method selection, performance evaluation, and model tuning) often do not differ much for structured versus unstructured data projects. Model selection is governed by the following factors: whether the data project involves labeled data (supervised learning) or unlabeled data (unsupervised learning); the type of data (numerical, continuous, or categorical; text data; image data; speech data; etc.); and the size of the dataset. Model performance evaluation involves error analysis using confusion matrixes, determining receiver operating characteristics, and calculating root mean square error. To carry out an error analysis for each model, a confusion matrix is created; true positives (TPs), true negatives (TNs), false positives (FPs), and false negatives (FNs) are determined. Then, the following performance metrics are calculated: accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall. The higher the accuracy and F1 score, the better the model performance. To carry out receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, ROC curves and area under the curve (AUC) of various models are calculated and compared. The more convex the ROC curve and the higher the AUC, the better the model performance. Model tuning involves managing the trade-off between model bias error, associated with underfitting, and model variance error, associated with overfitting. A fitting curve of in-sample (training sample) error and out-of-sample (cross-validation sample) error on the y-axis versus model complexity on the x-axis is useful for managing the bias vs. variance error trade-off. In a real-world big data project involving text data analysis for classifying and predicting sentiment of financial text for particular stocks, the text data are transformed into structured data for populating the DTM, which is then used as the input for the ML algorithm. To derive term frequency (TF) at the sentence level and TF–IDF, both of which can be inputs to the DTM, the following frequency measures should be used to create a term frequency measures table: TotalWordsInSentence; TotalWordCount; TermFrequency (Collection Level); WordCountInSentence; SentenceCountWithWord; Document Frequency; and Inverse Document Frequency.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/capital-market-expectations-framework-macro.pdf,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,2021,Level III,"A noted investment authority has written that the “fundamental law of investing is the uncertainty of the future.” Investors have no choice but to forecast elements of the future because nearly all investment decisions look toward it. Specifically, investment decisions incorporate the decision maker’s expectations concerning factors and events believed to affect investment values. The decision maker integrates these views into expectations about the risk and return prospects of individual assets and groups of assets. This reading’s focus is capital market expectations (CME): expectations concerning the risk and return prospects of asset classes, however broadly or narrowly the investor defines those asset classes. Capital market expectations are an essential input to formulating a strategic asset allocation. For example, if an investor’s investment policy statement specifies and defines eight permissible asset classes, the investor will need to have formulated long-term expectations concerning each of those asset classes. The investor may also act on short-term expectations. Insights into capital markets gleaned during CME setting should also help in formulating the expectations concerning individual assets that are needed in security selection and valuation. This is the first of two readings on capital market expectations. A central theme of both readings is that a disciplined approach to setting expectations will be rewarded. With that in mind, Section 2 of this reading presents a general framework for developing capital market expectations and alerts the reader to the range of problems and pitfalls that await investors and analysts in this arena. Section 3 focuses on the use of macroeconomic analysis in setting expectations. The second of the two CME readings builds on this foundation to address setting expectations for specific asset classes: equities, fixed income, real estate, and currencies. Various analytical tools are reviewed as needed throughout both readings.","The member should be able to: discuss the role of, and a framework for, capital market expectations in the portfolio management process; discuss challenges in developing capital market forecasts; explain how exogenous shocks may affect economic growth trends; discuss the application of economic growth trend analysis to the formulation of capital market expectations; compare major approaches to economic forecasting; discuss how business cycles affect short- and long-term expectations; explain the relationship of inflation to the business cycle and the implications of inflation for cash, bonds, equity, and real estate returns; discuss the effects of monetary and fiscal policy on business cycles; interpret the shape of the yield curve as an economic predictor and discuss the relationship between the yield curve and fiscal and monetary policy; identify and interpret macroeconomic, interest rate, and exchange rate linkages between economies.","This is the first of two readings on how investment professionals should address the setting of capital market expectations. The reading began with a general framework for developing capital market expectations followed by a review of various challenges and pitfalls that analysts may encounter in the forecasting process. The remainder of the reading focused on the use of macroeconomic analysis in setting expectations. The following are the main points covered in the reading: Capital market expectations are essential inputs for strategic as well as tactical asset allocation. The ultimate objective is a set of projections with which to make informed investment decisions, specifically asset allocation decisions. Undue emphasis should not be placed on the accuracy of projections for individual asset classes. Internal consistency across asset classes (cross-sectional consistency) and over various time horizons (intertemporal consistency) are far more important objectives. The process of capital market expectations setting involves the following steps: Specify the set of expectations that are needed, including the time horizon(s) to which they apply. Research the historical record. Specify the method(s) and/or model(s) that will be used and their information requirements. Determine the best sources for information needs. Interpret the current investment environment using the selected data and methods, applying experience and judgment. Provide the set of expectations and document the conclusions. Monitor outcomes, compare to forecasts, and provide feedback. Among the challenges in setting capital market expectations are: limitations of economic data including lack of timeliness as well as changing definitions and calculations; data measurement errors and biases including transcription errors, survivorship bias, and appraisal (smoothed) data; limitations of historical estimates including lack of precision, nonstationarity, asynchronous observations, and distributional considerations such as fat tails and skewness; ex post risk as a biased risk measure such as when historical returns reflect expectations of a low-probability catastrophe that did not occur or capture a low-probability event that did happen to occur; bias in methods including data-mining and time-period biases; failure to account for conditioning information ; misinterpretation of correlations ; psychological biases including anchoring, status quo, confirmation, overconfidence, prudence, and availability biases. model uncertainty . Losing sight of the connection between investment outcomes and the economy is a fundamental, and potentially costly, mistake in setting capital market expectations. Some growth trend changes are driven by slowly evolving and easily observable factors that are easy to forecast. Trend changes arising from exogenous shocks are impossible to forecast and difficult to identify, assess, and quantify until the change is well established. Among the most important sources of shocks are policy changes, new products and technologies, geopolitics, natural disasters, natural resources/critical inputs, and financial crises. An economy’s aggregate trend growth rate reflects growth in labor inputs and growth in labor productivity. Extrapolating past trends in these components can provide a reasonable initial estimate of the future growth trend, which can be adjusted based on observable information. Less developed economies may require more significant adjustments because they are likely to be undergoing more rapid structural changes. The average level of real (nominal) default-free bond yields is linked to the trend rate of real (nominal) growth. The trend rate of growth provides an important anchor for estimating bond returns over horizons long enough for this reversion to prevail over cyclical and short-term forces. The trend growth rate provides an anchor for long-run equity appreciation. In the very long run, the aggregate value of equity must grow at a rate very close to the rate of GDP growth. There are three main approaches to economic forecasting: Econometric models : structural and reduced-form statistical models of key variables generate quantitative estimates, impose discipline on forecasts, may be robust enough to approximate reality, and can readily forecast the impact of exogenous variables or shocks. However, they tend to be complex, time-consuming to formulate, and potentially mis-specified, and they rarely forecast turning points well. Indicators : variables that lead, lag, or coincide with turns in the economy. This approach is the simplest, requiring only a limited number of published statistics. It can generate false signals, however, and is vulnerable to revisions that may overfit past data at the expense of the reliability of out-of-sample forecasts. Checklist(s) : subjective integration of information deemed relevant by the analyst. This approach is the most flexible but also the most subjective. It readily adapts to a changing environment, but ongoing collection and assessment of information make it time-consuming and also limit the depth and consistency of the analysis. The business cycle is the result of many intermediate frequency cycles that jointly generate most of the variation in aggregate economic activity. This explains why historical business cycles have varied in both duration and intensity and why it is difficult to project turning points in real time. The business cycle reflects decisions that (a) are made based on imperfect information and/or analysis with the expectation of future benefits, (b) require significant current resources and/or time to implement, and (c) are difficult and/or costly to reverse. Such decisions are, broadly defined, investment decisions. A typical business cycle has a number of phases. We split the cycle into five phases with the following capital market implications: Initial Recovery. Short-term interest rates and bond yields are low. Bond yields are likely to bottom. Stock markets may rise strongly. Cyclical/riskier assets such as small stocks, high-yield bonds, and emerging market securities perform well. Early Expansion. Short rates are moving up. Longer-maturity bond yields are stable or rising slightly. Stocks are trending up. Late Expansion. Interest rates rise, and the yield curve flattens. Stock markets often rise but may be volatile. Cyclical assets may underperform while inflation hedges outperform. Slowdown. Short-term interest rates are at or nearing a peak. Government bond yields peak and may then decline sharply. The yield curve may invert. Credit spreads widen, especially for weaker credits. Stocks may fall. Interest-sensitive stocks and “quality” stocks with stable earnings perform best. Contraction. Interest rates and bond yields drop. The yield curve steepens. The stock market drops initially but usually starts to rise well before the recovery emerges. Credit spreads widen and remain elevated until clear signs of a cycle trough emerge. At least three factors complicate translation of business cycle information into capital market expectations and profitable investment decisions. First, the phases of the cycle vary in length and amplitude. Second, it is not always easy to distinguish between cyclical forces and secular forces acting on the economy and the markets. Third, how, when, and by how much the markets respond to the business cycle is as uncertain as the cycle itself—perhaps more so. Business cycle information is likely to be most reliable/valuable in setting capital market expectations over horizons within the range of likely expansion and contraction phases. Transitory developments cloud shorter-term forecasts, whereas significantly longer horizons likely cover portions of multiple cycle phases. Information about the current cyclical state of the economy has no predictive value over very long horizons. Monetary policy is often used as a mechanism for intervention in the business cycle. This mechanism is inherent in the mandates of most central banks to maintain price stability and/or growth consistent with potential. Monetary policy aims to be countercyclical, but the ability to fine-tune the economy is limited and policy measures may exacerbate rather than moderate the business cycle. This risk is greatest at the top of the cycle when the central bank may overestimate the economy’s momentum and/or underestimate the potency of restrictive policies. Fiscal policy—government spending and taxation—can be used to counteract cyclical fluctuations in the economy. Aside from extreme situations, however, fiscal policy typically addresses objectives other than regulating short-term growth. So-called automatic stabilizers do play an important role in mitigating cyclical fluctuations. The Taylor Rule is a useful tool for assessing a central bank’s stance and for predicting how that stance is likely to evolve. The expectation that central banks could not implement negative policy rates proved to be unfounded in the aftermath of the 2007–2009 global financial crisis. Because major central banks combined negative policy rates with other extraordinary measures (notably quantitative easing), however, the effectiveness of the negative rate policy is unclear. The effectiveness of quantitative easing is also unclear. Negative interest rates, and the environment that gives rises to them, make the task of setting capital market expectations even more complex. Among the issues that arise are the following: It is difficult to justify negative rates as a “risk-free rate” to which risk premiums can be added to establish long-term “equilibrium” asset class returns. Historical data and quantitative models are even less likely to be reliable. Market relationships (e.g., the yield curve) are likely to be distorted by other concurrent policy measures. The mix of monetary and fiscal policies has its most apparent effect on the average level of interest rates and inflation. Persistently loose (tight) fiscal policy increases (reduces) the average level of real interest rates. Persistently loose (tight) monetary policy increases (reduces) the average levels of actual and expected inflation. The impact on nominal rates is ambiguous if one policy is persistently tight and the other persistently loose. Changes in the slope of the yield curve are driven primarily by the evolution of short rate expectations, which are driven mainly by the business cycle and policies. The slope of the curve may also be affected by debt management. The slope of the yield curve is useful as a predictor of economic growth and as an indicator of where the economy is in the business cycle. Macroeconomic linkages between countries are expressed through their respective current and capital accounts. There are four primary mechanisms by which the current and capital accounts are kept in balance: changes in income (GDP), relative prices, interest rates and asset prices, and exchange rates. In the short run, interest rates, exchange rates, and financial asset prices must adjust to keep the capital account in balance with the more slowly evolving current account. The current account, in conjunction with real output and the relative prices of goods and services, tends to reflect secular trends and the pace of the business cycle. Interest rates and currency exchange rates are inextricably linked. This relationship is evident in the fact that a country cannot simultaneously allow unfettered capital flows, maintain a fixed exchange rate, and pursue an independent monetary policy. Two countries will share a default-free yield curve if (and only if) there is perfect capital mobility and the exchange rate is credibility fixed forever . It is the lack of credibly fixed exchange rates that allows (default-free) yield curves, and hence bond returns, to be less than perfectly correlated across markets. With floating exchange rates, the link between interest rates and exchange rates is primarily expectational. To equalize risk-adjusted expected returns across markets, interest rates must be higher (lower) in a currency that is expected to depreciate (appreciate). This dynamic can lead to the exchange rate “overshooting” in one direction to generate the expectation of movement in the opposite direction. An investor cares about the real return that he or she expects to earn in his or her own currency . In terms of a foreign asset, what matters is the nominal return and the change in the exchange rate. Although real interest rates around the world need not be equal, they are linked through the requirement that global savings must always equal global investment. Hence, they will tend to move together.

After outlining a framework for developing expectations and reviewing potential pitfalls, the first reading focused on the use of macroeconomic analysis in setting expectations. This reading builds on that foundation and examines setting expectations for specific asset classes—fixed income, equities, real estate, and currencies. Estimation of variance–covariance matrices is covered as well. The reading begins with an overview of the techniques frequently used to develop capital market expectations. The discussion of specific asset classes begins with fixed income in Section 3, followed by equities, real estate, and currencies in Sections 4–6. Estimation of variance–covariance structures is addressed in Section 7. Section 8 illustrates the use of macroeconomic analysis to develop and justify adjustments to a global portfolio.",The member should be able to: discuss approaches to setting expectations for fixed-income returns; discuss risks faced by investors in emerging market fixed-income securities and the country risk analysis techniques used to evaluate emerging market economies; discuss approaches to setting expectations for equity investment market returns; discuss risks faced by investors in emerging market equity securities; explain how economic and competitive factors can affect expectations for real estate investment markets and sector returns; discuss major approaches to forecasting exchange rates; discuss methods of forecasting volatility; recommend and justify changes in the component weights of a global investment portfolio based on trends and expected changes in macroeconomic factors.,"The following are the main points covered in the reading. The choice among forecasting techniques is effectively a choice of the information on which forecasts will be conditioned and how that information will be incorporated into the forecasts. The formal forecasting tools most commonly used in forecasting capital market returns fall into three broad categories: statistical methods, discounted cash flow models, and risk premium models. Sample statistics, especially the sample mean, are subject to substantial estimation error. Shrinkage estimation combines two estimates (or sets of estimates) into a more precise estimate. Time-series estimators, which explicitly incorporate dynamics, may summarize historical data well without providing insight into the underlying drivers of forecasts. Discounted cash flow models are used to estimate the required return implied by an asset’s current price. The risk premium approach expresses expected return as the sum of the risk-free rate of interest and one or more risk premiums. There are three methods for modeling risk premiums: equilibrium models, such as the CAPM; factor models; and building blocks. The DCF method is the only one that is precise enough to use in support of trades involving individual fixed-income securities. There are three main methods for developing expected returns for fixed-income asset classes: DCF, building blocks, and inclusion in an equilibrium model. As a forecast of bond return, YTM, the most commonly quoted metric, can be improved by incorporating the impact of yield changes on reinvestment of cash flows and valuation at the investment horizon. The building blocks for fixed-income expected returns are the short-term default-free rate, the term premium, the credit premium, and the liquidity premium. Term premiums are roughly proportional to duration, whereas credit premiums tend to be larger at the short end of the curve. Both term premiums and credit premiums are positively related to the slope of the yield curve. Credit spreads reflect both the credit premium (i.e., additional expected return) and expected losses due to default. A baseline estimate of the liquidity premium can be based on the yield spread between the highest-quality issuer in a market (usually the sovereign) and the next highest-quality large issuer (often a government agency). Emerging market debt exposes investors to heightened risk with respect to both ability to pay and willingness to pay, which can be associated with the economy and political/legal weaknesses, respectively. The Grinold–Kroner model decomposes the expected return on equities into three components: (1) expected cash flow return, composed of the dividend yield minus the rate of change in shares outstanding, (2) expected return due to nominal earnings growth, and (3) expected repricing return, reflecting the rate of change in the P/E. Forecasting the equity premium directly is just as difficult as projecting the absolute level of equity returns, so the building block approach provides little, if any, specific insight with which to improve equity return forecasts. The Singer–Terhaar version of the international capital asset pricing model combines a global CAPM equilibrium that assumes full market integration with expected returns for each asset class based on complete segmentation. Emerging market equities expose investors to the same underlying risks as emerging market debt does: more fragile economies, less stable political and policy frameworks, and weaker legal protections. Emerging market investors need to pay particular attention to the ways in which the value of their ownership claims might be expropriated. Among the areas of concern are standards of corporate governance, accounting and disclosure standards, property rights laws, and checks and balances on governmental actions. Historical return data for real estate is subject to substantial smoothing, which biases standard volatility estimates downward and distorts correlations with other asset classes. Meaningful analysis of real estate as an asset class requires explicit handling of this data issue. Real estate is subject to boom–bust cycles that both drive and are driven by the business cycle. The cap rate, defined as net operating income in the current period divided by the property value, is the standard valuation metric for commercial real estate. A model similar to the Grinold–Kroner model can be applied to estimate the expected return on real estate: E ( R re ) = Cap rate + NOI growth rate − %ΔCap rate. There is a clear pattern of higher cap rates for riskier property types, lower-quality properties, and less attractive locations. Real estate expected returns contain all the standard building block risk premiums: Term premium: As a very long-lived asset with relatively stable cash flows, income-producing real estate has a high duration. Credit premium: A fixed-term lease is like a corporate bond issued by the leaseholder and secured by the property. Equity premium: Owners bear the risk of property value fluctuations, as well as risk associated with rent growth, lease renewal, and vacancies. Liquidity premium: Real estate trades infrequently and is costly to transact. Currency exchange rates are especially difficult to forecast because they are tied to governments, financial systems, legal systems, and geographies. Forecasting exchange rates requires identification and assessment of the forces that are likely to exert the most influence. Provided they can be financed, trade flows do not usually exert a significant impact on exchange rates. International capital flows are typically larger and more volatile than trade-financing flows. PPP is a poor predictor of exchange rate movements over short to intermediate horizons but is a better guide to currency movements over progressively longer multi-year horizons. The extent to which the current account balance influences the exchange rate depends primarily on whether it is likely to be persistent and, if so, whether it can be sustained. Capital seeks the highest risk-adjusted expected return. In a world of perfect capital mobility, in the long run, the exchange rate will be driven to the point at which the expected percentage change equals the “excess” risk-adjusted expected return on the portfolio of assets denominated in the domestic currency over that of the portfolio of assets denominated in the foreign currency. However, in the short run, there can be an exchange rate overshoot in the opposite direction as hot money chases higher returns. Carry trades are profitable on average, which is contrary to the predictions of uncovered interest rate parity. Each country/currency has a unique portfolio of assets that makes up part of the global “market portfolio.” Exchange rates provide an across-the-board mechanism for adjusting the relative sizes of these portfolios to match investors’ desire to hold them. The portfolio balance perspective implies that exchange rates adjust in response to changes in the relative sizes and compositions of the aggregate portfolios denominated in each currency. The sample variance–covariance matrix is an unbiased estimate of the true VCV structure; that is, it will be correct on average. There are two main problems with using the sample VCV matrix as an estimate/forecast of the true VCV matrix: It cannot be used for large numbers of asset classes, and it is subject to substantial sampling error. Linear factor models impose structure on the VCV matrix that allows them to handle very large numbers of asset classes. The drawback is that the VCV matrix is biased and inconsistent unless the assumed structure is true. Shrinkage estimation of the VCV matrix is a weighted average of the sample VCV matrix and a target VCV matrix that reflects assumed “prior” knowledge of the true VCV structure. Failure to adjust for the impact of smoothing in observed return data for real estate and other private assets will almost certainly lead to distorted portfolio analysis and hence poor asset allocation decisions. Financial asset returns exhibit volatility clustering, evidenced by periods of high and low volatilities. ARCH models were developed to address these time-varying volatilities. One of the simplest and most used ARCH models represents today’s variance as a linear combination of yesterday’s variance and a new “shock” to volatility. With appropriate parameter values, the model exhibits the volatility clustering characteristic of financial asset returns.

Section 4 concludes and summarizes the reading.","The member should be able to: describe the reasons for a written investment policy statement (IPS); describe the major components of an IPS; describe risk and return objectives and how they may be developed for a client; distinguish between the willingness and the ability (capacity) to take risk in analyzing an investor’s financial risk tolerance; describe the investment constraints of liquidity, time horizon, tax concerns, legal and regulatory factors, and unique circumstances and their implications for the choice of portfolio assets; explain the specification of asset classes in relation to asset allocation; describe the principles of portfolio construction and the role of asset allocation in relation to the IPS; describe how environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations may be integrated into portfolio planning and construction.","In this reading, we have discussed construction of a client’s investment policy statement, including discussion of risk and return objectives and the various constraints that will apply to the portfolio. We have also discussed the portfolio construction process, with emphasis on the strategic asset allocation decisions that must be made. The IPS is the starting point of the portfolio management process. Without a full understanding of the client’s situation and requirements, it is unlikely that successful results will be achieved. The IPS can take a variety of forms. A typical format will include the client’s investment objectives and also list the constraints that apply to the client’s portfolio. The client’s objectives are specified in terms of risk tolerance and return requirements. The constraints section covers factors that need to be considered when constructing a portfolio for the client that meets the objectives. The typical constraint categories are liquidity requirements, time horizon, regulatory requirements, tax status, and unique needs. Clients may have personal objections to certain products or practices, which could lead to the exclusion of certain companies, countries, or types of securities from the investable universe as well as the client’s benchmark. Such considerations are often referred to as ESG (environmental, social, governance). ESG considerations can be integrated into an investment policy by exclusionary screening, best-in-class selection, active ownership, thematic and impact investing and ESG integration in security analysis. Risk objectives are specifications for portfolio risk that reflect the risk tolerance of the client. Quantitative risk objectives can be absolute or relative or a combination of the two. The client’s overall risk tolerance is a function of the client’s ability to accept risk and their “risk attitude,” which can be considered the client’s willingness to take risk. The client’s return objectives can be stated on an absolute or a relative basis. As an example of an absolute objective, the client may want to achieve a particular percentage rate of return. Alternatively, the return objective can be stated on a relative basis, for example, relative to a benchmark return. The liquidity section of the IPS should state what the client’s requirements are to draw cash from the portfolio. The time horizon section of the IPS should state the time horizon over which the investor is investing. This horizon may be the period during which the portfolio is accumulating before any assets need to be withdrawn. Tax status varies among investors and a client’s tax status should be stated in the IPS. The IPS should state any legal or regulatory restrictions that constrain the investment of the portfolio. The unique circumstances section of the IPS should cover any other aspect of a client’s circumstances that is likely to have a material impact on the composition of the portfolio. Certain ESG implementation approaches, such as negative (exclusionary) screening, best-in-class, thematic investing, impact investing, and ESG integration may be discussed in this section. Asset classes are the building blocks of an asset allocation. An asset class is a category of assets that have similar characteristics, attributes, and risk/return relationships. Traditionally, investors have distinguished cash, equities, bonds, and real estate as the major asset classes. A strategic asset allocation results from combining the constraints and objectives articulated in the IPS and capital market expectations regarding the asset classes. As time goes on, a client’s asset allocation will drift from the target allocation, and the amount of allowable drift as well as a rebalancing policy should be formalized. In addition to taking systematic risk, an investment committee may choose to take tactical asset allocation risk or security selection risk. The amount of return attributable to these decisions can be measured. ESG considerations may be integrated into the portfolio planning and construction process. Such considerations can be difficult given that ESG data is often not required to be disclosed by companies. ESG implementation approaches require a set of instructions for investment managers with regards to the selection of securities, the exercise of shareholder rights and the selection of investment strategies.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/behavioral-biases-individuals.pdf,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,2021,Level III,"Much of traditional economic and financial theory is based on the assumptions that individuals act rationally and consider all available information in the decision-making process and that markets are efficient. Behavioral finance challenges these assumptions and explores how individuals and markets actually behave. To differentiate the study of individual investor behavior from the study of collective market behavior, the subject of behavioral finance can be classified as Behavioral Finance Micro (BFMI) and Behavioral Finance Macro (BFMA). BFMI examines the behavioral biases that distinguish individual investors from the rational decision makers of traditional finance. BFMA detects and describes market anomalies that distinguish markets from the efficient markets of traditional finance. In this reading, we focus on BFMI and the behavioral biases that individuals may exhibit when making financial decisions. BFMI attempts to observe and explain how individuals make financial decisions. This approach is in contrast to traditional theories of financial decision making that describe how people should make decisions under uncertainty. Many prominent researchers have demonstrated that when people are faced with complex decision-making situations that demand substantial time and effort, they have difficulty devising completely rational approaches to developing and analyzing various courses of action. Facing uncertainty and an abundance of information to process, individuals may not systematically describe problems, record necessary data, or synthesize information to create rules for making decisions. Instead, individuals may follow a more subjective, suboptimal path of reasoning to determine a course of action consistent with their basic judgments and preferences. A decision maker may have neither the time nor the ability to arrive at a perfectly optimal decision. Individuals strive to make good decisions by simplifying the choices available, using a subset of the information available, and discarding some possible alternatives to choose among a smaller number. They are content to accept a solution that is “good enough” rather than attempting to find the optimal answer. In doing so, they may unintentionally bias the decision-making process. These biases may lead to irrational behaviors and decisions. By understanding behavioral biases, investment professionals may be able to improve economic outcomes. This may entail identifying behavioral biases they themselves exhibit or behavioral biases of others, including clients. Once a behavioral bias has been identified, it may be possible to either moderate the bias or adapt to the bias so that the resulting financial decisions more closely match the rational financial decisions assumed by traditional finance. Knowledge of and integration of behavioral and traditional finance may lead to superior results. Section 2 describes and broadly characterizes behavioral biases. Sections 3 and 4 discuss specific behavioral biases within two broad categories: cognitive errors and emotional biases. The discussion will include a description of the bias, potential consequences of the bias, detection of the bias, and guidance on moderating the effects of the bias. A summary and practice problems conclude the reading.",The member should be able to: distinguish between cognitive errors and emotional biases; discuss commonly recognized behavioral biases and their implications for financial decision making; identify and evaluate an individual’s behavioral biases;,"Behavioral biases potentially affect the behaviors and decisions of financial market participants. By understanding behavioral biases, financial market participants may be able to moderate or adapt to the biases and as a result improve upon economic outcomes. These biases may be categorized as either cognitive errors or emotional biases. The type of bias influences whether the impact of the bias is moderated or adapted to. Among the points made in this reading are the following: Individuals do not necessarily act rationally and consider all available information in the decision-making process because they may be influenced by behavioral biases. Biases may lead to sub-optimal decisions. Behavioral biases may be categorized as either cognitive errors or emotional biases. A single bias may, however, have aspects of both with one type of bias dominating. Cognitive errors stem from basic statistical, information-processing, or memory errors; cognitive errors typically result from faulty reasoning. Emotional biases stem from impulse or intuition; emotional biases tend to result from reasoning influenced by feelings. Cognitive errors are more easily corrected for because they stem from faulty reasoning rather than an emotional predisposition. Emotional biases are harder to correct for because they are based on feelings, which can be difficult to change. To adapt to a bias is to recognize and accept the bias and to adjust for the bias rather than to attempt to moderate the bias. To moderate a bias is to recognize the bias and to attempt to reduce or even eliminate the bias within the individual. Cognitive errors can be further classified into two categories: belief perseverance biases and information-processing biases. Belief perseverance errors reflect an inclination to maintain beliefs. The belief is maintained by committing statistical, information-processing, or memory errors. Belief perseverance biases are closely related to the psychological concept of cognitive dissonance. Belief perseverance biases include conservatism, confirmation, representativeness, illusion of control, and hindsight. Information-processing biases result in information being processed and used illogically or irrationally. Information-processing biases include anchoring and adjustment, mental accounting, framing, and availability. Emotional biases include loss aversion, overconfidence, self-control, status quo, endowment, and regret aversion. Understanding and detecting biases is the first step in overcoming the effect of biases on financial decisions. By understanding behavioral biases, financial market participants may be able to moderate or adapt to the biases and as a result improve upon economic outcomes.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/case-study-risk-management-private-wealth.pdf,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,2021,Level III,"Giving advice on risk management to individuals and families raises a number of challenges. These challenges include the extent to which identified and evaluated risks can be reduced and/or addressed using insurance policies or self-insurance. Families’ financial circumstances and risks evolve over time, and financial advisers should review and update the solutions addressing these risks accordingly. Risk management solutions recommended by advisers should consider the family’s overall health, wealth, and long-term goals. This case study explores some of the risk management issues for a married couple living in a hypothetical country in the Eurozone. The case spans several decades and follows the couple through different stages of life from their early career phase, when they are in their late twenties, all the way to retirement. We will show how risk management methods need to change as the family’s circumstances evolve. Particularly important prior readings related to this case are the Level III readings “Risk Management for Individuals” and “Overview of Private Wealth Management.” The assumptions used are drawn from what is typical for many countries in Europe. The circumstances and risks that this married couple face are influenced by the environment in which they find themselves. Despite the differences between Europe and other parts of the world, however, their goals, the risks they face, and the assessment of their circumstances, as well as the suggested methods, are by no means unique to the region. The risk analysis methodology and its application would therefore be valid in a much broader context. For simplicity, we assume that economic conditions and tax rates remain unchanged throughout the four decades that this case study spans. The terms “adviser” and “wealth manager” are used interchangeably throughout this case study. The amounts that appear in exhibits throughout the case study are rounded. The case is divided into six major sections. Section 2 provides background information about the hypothetical country in which the Schmitt family resides. Section 3 provides initial case facts relating to the family’s early career stage and risk management analysis, as well as solutions relevant to that stage. In Section 4, we revisit the couple in their career development stage when they are 45 years old. In Sections 5 and 6, we examine their lives at age 55, in peak accumulation phase, and age 64, when they are preparing to retire. The final section provides a summary of the case.",The member should be able to: identify and analyze a family’s risk exposures during the early career stage; recommend and justify methods to manage a family’s risk exposures during the early career stage; identify and analyze a family’s risk exposures during the career development stage; recommend and justify methods to manage a family’s risk exposures during the career development stage; identify and analyze a family’s risk exposures during the peak accumulation stage; recommend and justify methods to manage a family’s risk exposures during the peak accumulation stage; identify and analyze a family’s risk exposures during the early retirement stage; recommend and justify a plan to manage risks to an individual’s retirement lifestyle goals.,"This case study follows a family from the early career to the retirement stage. It touches on a small and simplified selection of a wide range of issues and considerations that a family may face. A great range of skills and competencies is required to provide financial advice, ranging from the ability to conduct in-depth risk analysis, all the way to making recommendations on risk mitigation strategies, including the choice of insurance products, to perform asset allocation, tax optimization, retirement planning, and estate planning. All of this must be done with a clear understanding of the applicable legal environment and of the level of access and the cost of accessing financial products. In practice, it is very unlikely that a single financial professional can master all the foregoing competencies. The key to success is to understand at what point the generalist needs to bring in, or refer the client to, a subject matter expert. In this case study: We identify and analyze the Schmitts’ risk exposures. We observed that the types of risk exposure change substantially from the early career stage to the early retirement stage. We conducted the analysis holistically, starting from the economic balance sheet, including human capital. We recommend and justify methods to manage the Schmitt family’s risk exposures at different stages of their professional life. We use insurance, self-insurance, and adjustments to their investment portfolio. We prepare summaries of the Schmitts’ risk exposures and the selected methods of managing those risk exposures. We recommend and justify modifications to the Schmitts’ life and disability insurance at different stages of the income earners’ lives. Finally, we recommend a justified a plan to manage risk to the Schmitts’ retirement lifestyle goals.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/analysis-financial-institutions.pdf,Financial Reporting and Analysis,2021,Level II,"Financial institutions provide a wide range of financial products and services. They serve as intermediaries between providers and recipients of capital, facilitate asset and risk management, and execute transactions involving cash, securities, and other financial assets. Given the diversity of financial services, it is unsurprising that numerous types of financial institutions exist. Types of financial institutions include deposit-taking, loan-making institutions (referred to as banks in this reading), investment banks, credit card companies, brokers, dealers, exchanges, clearing houses, depositories, investment managers, financial advisers, and insurance companies. In many situations, overlap of services exists across types of institutions. For example, banks not only take deposits and make loans but also may undertake investment management and other securities-related activities and may offer such products as derivatives, which are effectively insurance against adverse effects of movements in the interest rate, equity, and foreign currency markets. As another example of overlap, life insurance companies not only provide mortality-related insurance products but also offer savings vehicles. This reading focuses primarily on two types of financial institutions: banks (broadly defined as deposit-taking, loan-making institutions) and insurance companies. Section 2 explains what makes financial institutions different from other types of companies, such as manufacturers or merchandisers. Section 3 discusses how to analyze a bank. Section 4 focuses on analyzing insurance companies. A summary of key points concludes the reading.","The member should be able to: describe how financial institutions differ from other companies; describe key aspects of financial regulations of financial institutions; explain the CAMELS (capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity) approach to analyzing a bank, including key ratios and its limitations; describe other factors to consider in analyzing a bank; analyze a bank based on financial statements and other factors; describe key ratios and other factors to consider in analyzing an insurance company.","Financial institutions’ systemic importance results in heavy regulation of their activities. Systemic risk refers to the risk of impairment in some part of the financial system that then has the potential to spread throughout other parts of the financial system and thereby to negatively affect the entire economy. The Basel Committee, a standing committee of the Bank for International Settlements, includes representatives from central banks and bank supervisors from around the world. The Basel Committee’s international regulatory framework for banks includes minimum capital requirements, minimum liquidity requirements, and stable funding requirements. Among the international organizations that focus on financial stability are the Financial Stability Board, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, the International Association of Deposit Insurers, and the International Organization of Securities Commissions. Another distinctive feature of financial institutions (compared to manufacturing or merchandising companies) is that their productive assets are predominantly financial assets, such as loans and securities, creating greater direct exposures to a variety of risks, such as credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk, and interest rate risk. In general, the values of their assets are relatively close to fair market values. A widely used approach to analyzing a bank, CAMELS, considers a bank’s C apital adequacy, A sset quality, M anagement capabilities, E arnings sufficiency, L iquidity position, and S ensitivity to market risk. “ C apital adequacy,” described in terms of the proportion of the bank’s assets that is funded with capital, indicates that a bank has enough capital to absorb potential losses without severely damaging its financial position. “ A sset quality” includes the concept of quality of the bank’s assets—credit quality and diversification—and the concept of overall sound risk management. “ M anagement capabilities” refers to the bank management’s ability to identify and exploit appropriate business opportunities and to simultaneously manage associated risks. “ E arnings” refers to the bank’s return on capital relative to cost of capital and also includes the concept of earnings quality. “ L iquidity” refers to the amount of liquid assets held by the bank relative to its near-term expected cash flows. Under Basel III, liquidity also refers to the stability of the bank’s funding sources. “ S ensitivity to market risk” pertains to how adverse changes in markets (including interest rate, exchange rate, equity, and commodity markets) could affect the bank’s earnings and capital position. In addition to the CAMELS components, important attributes deserving analysts’ attention include government support, the banking entity’s mission, corporate culture and competitive environment, off-balance-sheet items, segment information, currency exposure, and risk disclosures. Insurance companies are typically categorized as property and casualty (P&C) or life and health (L&H). Insurance companies earn revenues from premiums (amounts paid by the purchaser of insurance products) and from investment income earned on the float (amounts collected as premiums and not yet paid out as benefits). P&C insurers’ policies are usually short term, and the final cost will usually be known within a year of a covered event, whereas L&H insurers’ policies are usually longer term. P&C insurers’ claims are more variable, whereas L&H insurers’ claims are more predictable. For both types of insurance companies, important areas for analysis include business profile, earnings characteristics, investment returns, liquidity, and capitalization. In addition, analysis of P&C companies’ profitability includes analysis of loss reserves and the combined ratio.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/active-equity-investing-portfolio-construction.pdf,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,2021,Level III,"Active equity investing is based on the concept that a skilled portfolio manager can both identify and differentiate between the most attractive securities and the least attractive securities—typically relative to a pre-specified benchmark. If this is the case, why is a portfolio—a collection of securities—even necessary? Why shouldn’t the portfolio manager just identify the most attractive security and invest all assets in this one security? Or in a long/short context, why not buy the “best” security and sell the “worst” one? Although very simple, this one-stock approach is not likely to be optimal or even feasible. No manager has perfect foresight, and his predictions will likely differ from realized returns. What he predicted would be the “best security” may quite likely turn out not to be the best. Active equity portfolio managers, even those with great skill, cannot avoid this risk. Security analysis is the process for ranking the relative attractiveness of securities, whereas portfolio construction is about selecting the securities to be included and carefully determining what percentage of the portfolio is to be held in each security—balancing superior insights regarding predicted returns against some likelihood that these insights will be derailed by events unknown or simply prove to be inaccurate. Active managers rely on a wide array of investment strategies and methodologies to build portfolios of securities that they expect to outperform the benchmark. The challenges faced by active managers are similar whether they manage long-only traditional strategies, systematic/quantitative strategies, or long/short opportunistic strategies. Managers may differ in their investment style, operational complexity, flexibility of investment policy, ability to use leverage and short positions, and implementation methodologies, but predictions about returns and risk are essential to most active equity management styles. In Section 2, we introduce the “building blocks” of portfolio construction, and in Section 3, we discuss the different approaches to portfolio construction. In Sections 4 and 5, we discuss risk budgeting concepts relevant to portfolio construction and the measures used to evaluate portfolio risk. Section 6 looks at how issues of scale may affect portfolio construction. Section 7 addresses the attributes of a well-constructed portfolio. Section 8 looks at certain specialized equity strategies and how their approaches to portfolio construction may differ from a long-only equity strategy. The reading concludes with a summary.","The member should be able to: describe elements of a manager’s investment philosophy that influence the portfolio construction process; discuss approaches for constructing actively managed equity portfolios; distinguish between Active Share and active risk and discuss how each measure relates to a manager’s investment strategy; discuss the application of risk budgeting concepts in portfolio construction; discuss risk measures that are incorporated in equity portfolio construction and describe how limits set on these measures affect portfolio construction; discuss how assets under management, position size, market liquidity, and portfolio turnover affect equity portfolio construction decisions; evaluate the efficiency of a portfolio structure given its investment mandate; discuss the long-only, long extension, long/short, and equitized market-neutral approaches to equity portfolio construction, including their risks, costs, and effects on potential alphas.","Active equity portfolio construction strives to make sure that superior insights about forecasted returns get efficiently reflected in realized portfolio performance. Active equity portfolio construction is about thoroughly understanding the return objectives of a portfolio, as well as its acceptable risk levels, and then finding the right mix of securities that balances predicted returns against risk and other impediments that can interfere with realizing these returns. These principles apply to long-only, long/short, long-extension, and market-neutral approaches. Below, we highlight the discussions of this reading. The four main building blocks of portfolio construction are the following: Overweight, underweight, or neutralize rewarded factors: The four most recognized factors known to offer a persistent return premium are Market, Size, Value, and Momentum. Alpha skills: Timing factors, securities, and markets. Finding new factors and enhancing existing factors. Sizing positions to account for risk and active weights. Breadth of expertise: A manager’s ability to consistently outperform his benchmark increases when that performance can be attributed to a larger sample of independent decisions. Independent decisions are uncorrelated decisions. Managers can rely on a combination of approaches to implement their core beliefs: Systematic vs. discretionary Systematic strategies incorporate research-based rules across a broad universe of securities. Discretionary strategies integrate the judgment of the manager on a smaller subset of securities. Bottom up vs. top down A bottom-up manager evaluates the risk and return characteristics of individual securities. The aggregate of these risk and return expectations implies expectations for the overall economic and market environment. A top-down manager starts with an understanding of the overall market environment and then projects how the expected environment will affect countries, asset classes, sectors, and securities. Benchmark aware vs. benchmark agnostic Portfolio construction can be framed as an optimization problem using an objective function and a set of constraints. The objective function of a systematic manager will be specified explicitly, whereas that of a discretionary manager may be set implicitly. Risk budgeting is a process by which the total risk appetite of the portfolio is allocated among the various components of portfolio choice. Active risk (tracking error) is a function of the portfolio’s exposure to systematic risks and the level of idiosyncratic, security-specific risk. It is a relevant risk measure for benchmark-relative portfolios. Absolute risk is the total volatility of portfolio returns independent of a benchmark. It is the most appropriate risk measure for portfolios with an absolute return objective. Active Share measures the extent to which the number and sizing of positions in a manager’s portfolio differ from the benchmark. Benchmark-agnostic managers usually have a greater level of Active Share and most likely have a greater level of active risk. An effective risk management process requires that the portfolio manager determine which type of risk measure is most appropriate, understand how each aspect of the strategy contributes to its overall risk, determine what level of risk budget is appropriate, and effectively allocate risk among individual positions/factors. Risk constraints may be either formal or heuristic. Heuristic constraints may impose limits on concentration by security, sector, industry, or geography; net exposures to risk factors, such as Beta, Size, Value, and Momentum; net exposures to currencies; the degree of leverage; the degree of illiquidity; exposures to reputational/environmental risks, such as carbon emissions; and other attributes related to an investor’s core concerns. Formal risk constraints are statistical in nature. Formal risk measures include the following: Volatility—the standard deviation of portfolio returns Active risk—also called tracking error or tracking risk Skewness—a measure of the degree to which return expectations are non-normally distributed Drawdown—a measure of portfolio loss from its high point until it begins to recover Value at risk (VaR)—the minimum loss that would be expected a certain percentage of the time over a certain period of time given the modeled market conditions, typically expressed as the minimum loss that can be expected to occur 5% of the time CVaR (expected tail loss or expected shortfall)—the average loss that would be incurred if the VaR cutoff is exceeded IVaR—the change in portfolio VaR when adding a new position to a portfolio MVaR—the effect on portfolio risk of a change in the position size. In a diversified portfolio, it may be used to determine the contribution of each asset to the overall VaR. Portfolio management costs fall into two categories: explicit costs and implicit costs. Implicit costs include delay and slippage. The costs of managing assets may affect the investment strategy and the portfolio construction process. Slippage costs are significantly greater for smaller-cap securities and during periods of high volatility. A strategy that demands immediate execution is likely to incur higher market impact costs. A patient manager can mitigate market impact costs by slowly building up positions as liquidity becomes available, but he exposes himself to greater volatility/trend price risk. A well-constructed portfolio exhibits a clear investment philosophy and a consistent investment process, risk and structural characteristics as promised to investors, a risk-efficient delivery methodology, and reasonably low operating costs. Long/short investing is a compromise between reducing risk and not capturing fully the market risk premium, expanding the return potential from alpha and other risk premiums at the potential expense of increasing active risk, and achieving greater diversification and higher costs and complexity.

The reading is organized around a classification of active equity strategies into two broad approaches: fundamental and quantitative. Both approaches aim at outperforming a passive benchmark (for example, a broad equity market index), but they tend to make investment decisions differently. Fundamental approaches stress the use of human judgment in processing information and making investment decisions, whereas quantitative approaches tend to rely more heavily on rules-based quantitative models. As a result, some practitioners and academics refer to the fundamental, judgment-based approaches as “discretionary” and to the rules-based, quantitative approaches as “systematic.” This reading is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces fundamental and quantitative approaches to active management. Section 3 discusses bottom-up, top-down, factor-based, and activist investing strategies. Section 4 describes the process of creating fundamental active investment strategies, including the parameters to consider as well as some of the pitfalls. Section 5 describes the steps required to create quantitative active investment strategies, as well as the pitfalls in a quantitative investment process. Section 6 discusses style classifications of active strategies and the uses and limitations of such classifications. A summary of key points completes the reading.","The member should be able to: compare fundamental and quantitative approaches to active management; analyze bottom-up active strategies, including their rationale and associated processes; analyze top-down active strategies, including their rationale and associated processes; analyze factor-based active strategies, including their rationale and associated processes; analyze activist strategies, including their rationale and associated processes; describe active strategies based on statistical arbitrage and market microstructure; describe how fundamental active investment strategies are created; describe how quantitative active investment strategies are created; discuss equity investment style classifications.","This reading discusses the different approaches to active equity management and describes how the various strategies are created. It also addresses the style classification of active approaches. Active equity management approaches can be generally divided into two groups: fundamental (also referred to as discretionary) and quantitative (also known as systematic or rules-based). Fundamental approaches stress the use of human judgment in arriving at an investment decision, whereas quantitative approaches stress the use of rules-based, quantitative models to arrive at a decision. The main differences between fundamental and quantitative approaches include the following characteristics: approach to the decision-making process (subjective versus objective); forecast focus (stock returns versus factor returns); information used (research versus data); focus of the analysis (depth versus breadth); orientation to the data (forward looking versus backward looking); and approach to portfolio risk (emphasis on judgment versus emphasis on optimization techniques). The main types of active management strategies include bottom-up, top-down, factor-based, and activist. Bottom-up strategies begin at the company level, and use company and industry analyses to assess the intrinsic value of the company and determine whether the stock is undervalued or overvalued relative to its market price. Fundamental managers often focus on one or more of the following company and industry characteristics: business model and branding, competitive advantages, and management and corporate governance. Bottom-up strategies are often divided into value-based approaches and growth-based approaches. Top-down strategies focus on the macroeconomic environment, demographic trends, and government policies to arrive at investment decisions. Top-down strategies are used in several investment decision processes, including the following: country and geographic allocation, sector and industry rotation, equity style rotation, volatility-based strategies, and thematic investment strategies. Quantitative equity investment strategies often use factor-based models. A factor-based strategy aims to identify significant factors that drive stock prices and to construct a portfolio with a positive bias towards such factors. Factors can be grouped based on fundamental characteristics—such as value, growth, and price momentum—or on unconventional data. Activist investors specialize in taking meaningful stakes in listed companies and influencing those companies to make changes to their management, strategy, or capital structures for the purpose of increasing the stock’s value and realizing a gain on their investment. Statistical arbitrage (or “stat arb”) strategies use statistical and technical analysis to exploit pricing anomalies and achieve superior returns. Pairs trading is an example of a popular and simple statistical arbitrage strategy. Event-driven strategies exploit market inefficiencies that may occur around corporate events such as mergers and acquisitions, earnings announcements, bankruptcies, share buybacks, special dividends, and spinoffs. The fundamental active investment process includes the following steps: define the investment universe; prescreen the universe; understand the industry and business; forecast the company’s financial performance; convert forecasts into a target price; construct the portfolio with the desired risk profile; and rebalance the portfolio according to a buy and sell discipline. Pitfalls in fundamental investing include behavioral biases, the value trap, and the growth trap. Behavioral biases can be divided into two groups: cognitive errors and emotional biases. Typical biases that are relevant to active equity management include confirmation bias, illusion of control, availability bias, loss aversion, overconfidence, and regret aversion. The quantitative active investment process includes the following steps: define the investment thesis; acquire, clean, and process the data; backtest the strategy; evaluate the strategy; and construct an efficient portfolio using risk and trading cost models. The pitfalls in quantitative investing include look-ahead and survivorship biases, overfitting, data mining, unrealistic turnover assumptions, transaction costs, and short availability. An investment style generally splits the stock universe into two or three groups, such that each group contains stocks with similar characteristics. The common style characteristics used in active management include value, size, price momentum, volatility, high dividend, and earnings quality. A stock’s membership in an industry, sector, or country group is also used to classify the investment style. Two main approaches are often used in style analysis: a returns-based approach and a holdings-based approach. Holdings-based approaches aggregate the style scores of individual holdings, while returns-based approaches analyze the investment style of portfolio managers by comparing the returns of the strategy to those of a set of style indexes.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/behavioral-finance-investment-processes.pdf,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,2021,Level III,"Much of current economic and financial theory is based on the assumptions that individuals act rationally and consider all available information in the decision-making process. Behavioral finance challenges these assumptions. The relaxing of these assumptions has implications at both the individual and market levels. It is important to note that, at the individual level, all market participants, whether they are less knowledgeable individual investors or experienced money managers, may act irrationally; in other words, all market participants may deviate from the behavior that is assumed in traditional financial theory. Some of these deviations have been identified and categorized as behavioral biases. In addition, individual behavioral biases may be reinforced in a group setting, which further complicates rational investment processes. This reading focuses on understanding individual investor behavior and how it affects adviser–client relationships and portfolio construction, as well as on the analyst-, committee-, and market-level impact of behavioral biases. Section 2 discusses how investors may be classified by type based on the biases and other behaviors they display and explains the uses and limitations of classifying investors into types. Section 3 discusses how behavioral factors affect adviser–client relationships. Section 4 examines the potential effects of behavioral biases on portfolio construction. Section 5 discusses how behavioral biases affect the work of analysts, looking specifically at their forecasts, and explores remedial actions for analyst biases. Section 6 examines committee decision making and how behavioral biases may be amplified or mitigated in a group setting, and discusses steps to make committees more effective. Section 7 discusses how behavioral finance influences market behavior by examining market anomalies and observed market behavior. A summary and practice problems conclude the reading.",The member should be able to: explain the uses and limitations of classifying investors into personality types; discuss how behavioral factors affect adviser–client interactions; discuss how behavioral factors influence portfolio construction; explain how behavioral finance can be applied to the process of portfolio construction; discuss how behavioral factors affect analyst forecasts and recommend remedial actions for analyst biases; discuss how behavioral factors affect investment committee decision making and recommend techniques for mitigating their effects; describe how behavioral biases of investors can lead to market characteristics that may not be explained by traditional finance.,"This reading includes suggestions on how to include behavioral considerations in financial decision making. The effects of including behavioral considerations in adviser–client relationships and portfolio construction are discussed. Finally, the reading considers the effect of behavioral factors on analyst forecasts, committee decision making, and market behavior. It is important to remember that all market participants, regardless of expertise, may exhibit behavior that differs from that assumed in traditional finance. Among the points made in this reading are the following: Classifying investors into investor types based on their characteristics, including level of risk tolerance, preferred approach to investing, and behavioral characteristics and biases, is useful for providing insight and financial decision making but should be used with some caution. Adviser–client relations and financial decisions will be more effective and satisfying if behavioral factors are taken into account. Including behavioral factors in portfolio construction may result in a portfolio that is closer to the efficient portfolio of traditional finance, while being easier for the client to understand and accept as suitable. By considering behavioral biases, it is possible to moderate their effects. All market participants, even those with significant knowledge of and experience in finance, may exhibit behavioral biases. Analysts are not immune. Analysts, in general, are prone to overconfidence, representativeness, availability, illusion of control, and hindsight biases. Awareness of their biases and their potential influences can help analysts put in place measures to help moderate the effect of these biases. Analysts interpreting information provided by management should consider and adjust for the biases that analysts and management teams are typically susceptible to, including framing, anchoring and adjustment, availability, and overconfidence. Management biases can affect both the choice of information presented and how it is presented. These may have an effect on the analysis. Committees often have the responsibility for making investment decisions and are subject to behavioral biases. It is important to implement procedures to alleviate the effect of behavioral biases and improve committee decision making. Behavioral finance has the potential to explain some apparent deviations from market efficiency (market anomalies).

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/case-study-portfolio-management-institutional.pdf,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,2021,Level III,"The development of a strategic asset allocation (SAA) for long-horizon institutional investors like university endowments raises special challenges. These include supporting spending policies while ensuring the long-term sustainability of the endowment and establishing optimal exposure to illiquid investment strategies in the context of a diversified portfolio. Large university endowments typically have significant exposure to illiquid asset classes. The exposure to illiquid asset classes impacts the portfolio’s overall liquidity profile and requires a comprehensive liquidity management approach to ensure liquidity needs can be met in a timely fashion. In addition, capital market conditions and asset prices change, resulting in a need to change asset allocation exposures and/or rebalance the portfolio to maintain a profile close to the strategic asset allocation. Derivatives are often used by institutions to manage liquidity needs and implement asset allocation changes. The cash-efficient nature of derivatives and their high levels of liquidity in many markets make them suitable tools for portfolio rebalancing, tactical exposure changes, and satisfying short-term liquidity needs—all while maintaining desired portfolio exposures. This case study explores these issues from the perspective of a large university endowment undertaking a review of its asset allocation and then implementing proposed allocation changes and a tactical overlay program. Rebalancing needs for the endowment arise as market moves result in drift of the endowment’s asset allocation. The case is divided into two major sections. The first section addresses issues relating to asset allocation and liquidity management. The case introduces a framework to support management of liquidity and cash needs in an orderly and timely manner while avoiding disruption to underlying managers and potentially capturing an illiquidity premium. Such concepts as time-to-cash tables and liquidity budgets are explored in detail. Aspects relating to rebalancing and maintaining a risk profile similar to the portfolio’s strategic asset allocation over time are also covered. The second section explores the use of derivatives in portfolio construction from a tactical asset allocation (TAA) overlay and rebalancing perspective. The suitability of futures, total return swaps, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is discussed based on their characteristics, associated costs, and desired portfolio objectives. The case also presents a cost–benefit analysis of derivatives and cash markets for implementing rebalancing decisions.",The member should be able to: discuss tools for managing portfolio liquidity risk; discuss capture of the illiquidity premium as an investment objective; analyze asset allocation and portfolio construction in relation to liquidity needs and risk and return requirements and recommend actions to address identified needs; analyze actions in asset manager selection with respect to the Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct; analyze the costs and benefits of derivatives versus cash market techniques for establishing or modifying asset class or risk exposures; demonstrate the use of derivatives overlays in tactical asset allocation and rebalancing.,"The QU endowment case study covers important aspects of institutional portfolio management involving the illiquidity premium capture, liquidity management, asset allocation, and the use of derivatives versus the cash market for tactical asset allocation and portfolio rebalancing. In addition, the case examines potential ethical violations in manager selection that can arise in the course of business. From an asset allocation perspective, the case highlights potential risk and rewards associated with increasing exposure to illiquidity risk through investments like private equity and private real estate. Although this exposure is expected to generate higher returns and more-efficient portfolios in the long-run, significant uncertainties are involved both from a modeling and implementation perspective.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/backtesting-and-simulation.pdf,Quantitative Methods,2021,Level II,"This reading provides an overview of backtesting and simulation of investment strategies. Backtesting and related techniques enable investment practitioners to simulate the performance of investment strategies (especially quantitative strategies) using historical data or data derived from the distributions of historical data, to generate test results, and to analyze risk and return, without investing any real capital in the strategies. The rise of big data and the increase in computing power have spurred the development and spread of quantitative investing. Almost every major data vendor has available tools that make systematic backtesting and simulation increasingly accessible. Off-the-shelf software allows backtesting and simulation of endless combinations of possible investment strategies, formulation of multifactor models, and construction of investable portfolios. Developing quantitative investment strategies may appear relatively straightforward, but in reality, it is not. However, understanding the steps and procedures, the implicit assumptions, the pitfalls, and the interpretation of results in backtesting and simulation is a prerequisite for proper utilization of these tools and successful development and implementation of investment strategies. In a CFA Institute survey of nearly 250 analysts, portfolio managers, and private wealth managers on quantitative investment techniques, 50% of respondents reported that they had conducted backtesting of an investment strategy within the past 12 months of the survey date. This result underscores the importance of backtesting (and other simulation techniques) for investors in practice, and this reading is a starting point on the journey to building this core professional competency.",The member should be able to: describe objectives in backtesting an investment strategy; describe and contrast steps and procedures in backtesting an investment strategy; interpret metrics and visuals reported in a backtest of an investment strategy; identify problems in a backtest of an investment strategy; describe different ways to construct multifactor models; compare methods of modeling randomness; evaluate and interpret a scenario analysis; contrast Monte Carlo and historical simulation; explain inputs and decisions in simulation and interpret a simulation; and demonstrate the use of sensitivity analysis.,"In this reading, we have discussed how to perform rolling window backtesting—a widely used technique in the investment industry. Next, we described how to use scenario analysis and simulation along with sensitivity analysis to supplement backtesting, so investors can better account for the randomness in data that may not be fully captured by backtesting. The main objective of backtesting is to understand the risk–return trade-off of an investment strategy, by approximating the real-life investment process. The basic steps in a rolling window backtesting include specifying the investment hypothesis and goals, determining the rules and processes behind an investment strategy, forming an investment portfolio according to the rules, rebalancing the portfolio periodically, and computing the performance and risk profiles of the strategy. In the rolling window backtesting methodology, researchers use a rolling window (or walk-forward) framework, fit/calibrate factors or trade signals based on the rolling window, rebalance the portfolio periodically, and then track the performance over time. Thus, rolling window backtesting is a proxy for actual investing. There are two commonly used approaches in backtesting—long/short hedged portfolio and Spearman rank IC. The two approaches often give similar results, but results can be quite different at times. Choosing the right approach depends on the model building and portfolio construction process. In assessing backtesting results, in addition to traditional performance measurements (e.g., Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown), analysts need to take into account data coverage, return distribution, factor efficacy, factor turnover, and decay. There are several behavioral issues in backtesting to which analysts need to pay particular attention, including survivorship bias and look-ahead bias. Risk parity is a popular portfolio construction technique that takes into account the volatility of each factor (or asset) and the correlations of returns between all factors (or assets) to be combined in the portfolio. The objective is for each factor (or asset) to make an equal (hence “parity”) risk contribution to the overall or targeted risk of the portfolio. Asset (and factor) returns are often negatively skewed and exhibit excess kurtosis (fat tails) and tail dependence compared with normal distribution. As a result, standard rolling window backtesting may not be able to fully account for the randomness in asset returns, particularly on downside risk. Financial data often face structural breaks. Scenario analysis can help investors understand the performance of an investment strategy in different structural regimes. Historical simulation is relatively straightforward to perform but shares pros and cons similar to those of rolling window backtesting. For example, a key assumption these methods share is that the distribution pattern from the historical data is sufficient to represent the uncertainty in the future. Bootstrapping (or random draws with replacement) is often used in historical simulation. Monte Carlo simulation is a more sophisticated technique than historical simulation is. In Monte Carlo simulation, the most important decision is the choice of functional form of the statistical distribution of decision variables/return drivers. Multivariate normal distribution is often used in investment research, owing to its simplicity. However, a multivariate normal distribution cannot account for negative skewness and fat tails observed in factor and asset returns. The Monte Carlo simulation technique makes use of the inverse transformation method—the process of converting a randomly generated uniformly distributed number into a simulated value of a random variable of a desired distribution. Sensitivity analysis, a technique for exploring how a target variable and risk profiles are affected by changes in input variables, can further help investors understand the limitations of conventional Monte Carlo simulation (which typically assumes a multivariate normal distribution as a starting point). A multivariate skewed t -distribution takes into account skewness and kurtosis but requires estimation of more parameters and thus is more likely to suffer from larger estimation errors.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/applications-financial-statement-analysis.pdf,Financial Reporting and Analysis,2021,Level I,"This reading presents several important applications of financial statement analysis. Among the issues we will address are the following: What are the key questions to address in evaluating a company’s past financial performance? How can an analyst approach forecasting a company’s future net income and cash flow? How can financial statement analysis be used to evaluate the credit quality of a potential fixed-income investment? How can financial statement analysis be used to screen for potential equity investments? How can differences in accounting methods affect financial ratio comparisons between companies, and what are some adjustments analysts make to reported financials to facilitate comparability among companies. The reading “Financial Statement Analysis: An Introduction” described a framework for conducting financial statement analysis. Consistent with that framework, prior to undertaking any analysis, an analyst should explore the purpose and context of the analysis. The purpose and context guide further decisions about the approach, the tools, the data sources, and the format in which to report results of the analysis, and also suggest which aspects of the analysis are most important. Having identified the purpose and context, the analyst should then be able to formulate the key questions that the analysis must address. The questions will suggest the data the analyst needs to collect to objectively address the questions. The analyst then processes and analyzes the data to answer these questions. Conclusions and decisions based on the analysis are communicated in a format appropriate to the context, and follow-up is undertaken as required. Although this reading will not formally present applications as a series of steps, the process just described is generally applicable. Section 2 of this reading describes the use of financial statement analysis to evaluate a company’s past financial performance, and Section 3 describes basic approaches to projecting a company’s future financial performance. Section 4 presents the use of financial statement analysis in assessing the credit quality of a potential debt investment. Section 5 concludes the survey of applications by describing the use of financial statement analysis in screening for potential equity investments. Analysts often encounter situations in which they must make adjustments to a company’s reported financial results to increase their accuracy or comparability with the financials of other companies. Section 6 illustrates several common types of analyst adjustments. Section 7 presents a summary, and practice problems in the CFA Institute multiple-choice format conclude the reading.",The member should be able to: evaluate a company’s past financial performance and explain how a company’s strategy is reflected in past financial performance; forecast a company’s future net income and cash flow; describe the role of financial statement analysis in assessing the credit quality of a potential debt investment; describe the use of financial statement analysis in screening for potential equity investments; explain appropriate analyst adjustments to a company’s financial statements to facilitate comparison with another company.,"This reading described selected applications of financial statement analysis, including the evaluation of past financial performance, the projection of future financial performance, the assessment of credit risk, and the screening of potential equity investments. In addition, the reading introduced analyst adjustments to reported financials. In all cases, the analyst needs to have a good understanding of the financial reporting standards under which the financial statements were prepared. Because standards evolve over time, analysts must stay current in order to make good investment decisions. The main points in the reading are as follows: Evaluating a company’s historical performance addresses not only what happened but also the causes behind the company’s performance and how the performance reflects the company’s strategy. The projection of a company’s future net income and cash flow often begins with a top-down sales forecast in which the analyst forecasts industry sales and the company’s market share. By projecting profit margins or expenses and the level of investment in working and fixed capital needed to support projected sales, the analyst can forecast net income and cash flow. Projections of future performance are needed for discounted cash flow valuation of equity and are often needed in credit analysis to assess a borrower’s ability to repay interest and principal of a debt obligation. Credit analysis uses financial statement analysis to evaluate credit-relevant factors, including tolerance for leverage, operational stability, and margin stability. When ratios constructed from financial statement data and market data are used to screen for potential equity investments, fundamental decisions include which metrics to use as screens, how many metrics to include, what values of those metrics to use as cutoff points, and what weighting to give each metric. Analyst adjustments to a company’s reported financial statements are sometimes necessary (e.g., when comparing companies that use different accounting methods or assumptions). Adjustments can include those related to investments; inventory; property, plant, and equipment; and goodwill.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/asset-allocation-alternative-investments.pdf,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,2021,Level III,"Asset allocation is a critical decision in the investment process. The mathematical and analytical processes inherent in contemporary asset allocation techniques are complicated by the idiosyncrasies of alternative investments. Approaches to incorporating alternative assets into the strategic asset allocation have developed rapidly as allocations to assets other than stocks and bonds have accelerated in the aftermath of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. The term “alternative” understates the prominence of alternative investment allocations in many investment programs, because institutional and private clients have been increasingly turning to these investments not just to supplement traditional long-only stocks and bonds but also sometimes to replace them altogether. For example, the Yale Endowment and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board both have close to 50% of their assets allocated to alternatives. Although these two funds are admittedly outliers, between 2008 and 2017 most of the pension funds around the world substantially expanded their allocations to alternative asset classes. On average, pension funds in developed markets increased their allocation from 7.2% to 11.8% of assets under management (AUM) in 2017, a 63% increase. “Alternative” investment has no universally accepted definition. For the purposes of this reading, alternative investments include private equity, hedge funds, real assets (including energy and commodity investments), commercial real estate, and private credit. The reading begins with a discussion of the role alternative assets play in a multi-asset portfolio and explores how alternatives may serve to mitigate long-only equity risk, a role traditionally held by bonds. We then consider different ways investors may define the opportunity set—through the traditional asset class lens or, more recently, using a risk- or factor-based lens. An allocation to alternatives is not for all investors, so the reading describes issues that should be addressed when considering an allocation to alternatives. We then discuss approaches to asset allocation when incorporating alternatives in the opportunity set and the need for liquidity planning in private investment alternatives. Finally, the reading discusses the unique monitoring requirements for an alternatives portfolio.","The member should be able to: explain the roles that alternative investments play in multi-asset portfolios; compare alternative investments and bonds as risk mitigators in relation to a long equity position; compare traditional and risk-based approaches to defining the investment opportunity set, including alternative investments; discuss investment considerations that are important in allocating to different types of alternative investments; discuss suitability considerations in allocating to alternative investments; discuss approaches to asset allocation to alternative investments; discuss the importance of liquidity planning in allocating to alternative investments; discuss considerations in monitoring alternative investment programs.","Allocations to alternatives are believed to increase a portfolio’s risk-adjusted return. An investment in alternatives typically fulfills one or more of four roles in an investor’s portfolio: capital growth, income generation, risk diversification, and/or safety. Private equity investments are generally viewed as return enhancers in a portfolio of traditional assets. Long/short equity strategies are generally believed to deliver equity-like returns with less than full exposure to the equity premium. Short-biased equity strategies are expected to lower a portfolio’s overall equity beta while producing some measure of alpha. Arbitrage and event-driven strategies are expected to provide equity-like returns with little to no correlation with traditional asset classes. Real assets (e.g., commodities, farmland, timber, energy, and infrastructure assets) are generally perceived to provide a hedge against inflation. Timber investments provide both growth and inflation-hedging properties. Commodities (e.g., metals, energy, livestock, and agricultural commodities) serve as a hedge against inflation and provide a differentiated source of alpha. Certain commodity investments serve as safe havens in times of crisis. Farmland investing may have a commodity-like profile or a commercial real-estate-like profile. Energy investments are generally considered a real asset as the investor owns the mineral rights to commodities that are correlated with inflation factors. Infrastructure investments tend to generate stable/modestly growing income and to have high correlation with overall inflation. Real estate strategies range from core to opportunistic and are believed to provide protection against unanticipated increases in inflation. Core real estate strategies are more income-oriented, while opportunistic strategies rely more heavily on capital appreciation. Bonds have been a more effective volatility mitigator than alternatives over shorter time horizons. The traditional approaches to defining asset classes are easy to communicate and implement. However, they tend to over-estimate portfolio diversification and obscure primary drivers of risk. Typical risk factors applied to alternative investments include equity, size, value, liquidity, duration, inflation, credit spread, and currency. A benefit of the risk factor approach is that every asset class can be described using the same framework. Risk factor-based approaches have certain limitations. A framework with too many factors is difficult to administer and interpret, but too small a set of risk factors may not accurately describe the characteristics of alternative asset classes. Risk factor sensitivities are highly sensitive to the historical look-back period. Investors with less than a 15-year investment horizon should generally avoid investments in private real estate, private real asset, and private equity funds. Investors must consider whether they have the necessary skills, expertise, and resources to build an alternative investment program internally. Investors without a strong governance program are less likely to develop a successful alternative investment program. Reporting for alternative funds is often less transparent than investors are accustomed to seeing on their stock and bond portfolios. For many illiquid strategies, reporting is often received well past typical monthly or quarter-end deadlines. Full, position-level transparency is rare in many alternative strategies. Three primary approaches are used to determine the desired allocation to the alternative asset classes: Monte Carlo simulation may be used to generate return scenarios that relax the assumption of normally distributed returns. Optimization techniques, which incorporate downside risk or take into account skew, may be used to enhance the asset allocation process. Risk factor-based approaches to alternative asset allocation can be applied to develop more robust asset allocation proposals. Two key analytical challenges in modelling allocations to alternatives include stale and/or artificially smoothed returns and return distributions that exhibit significant skewness and fat tails (or excess kurtosis). Artificially smoothed returns can be detected by testing the return stream for serial correlation. The analyst needs to unsmooth the returns to get a more accurate representation of the risk and return characteristics of the asset class. Skewness and kurtosis can be dealt with by using empirically observed asset returns because they incorporate the actual distribution. Advanced mathematical or statistical models can also be used to capture the true behavior of alternative asset classes. Applications of Monte Carlo simulation in allocating to alternative investments include: simulating skewed and fat-tailed financial variables by estimating the behavior of factors and/or assets in low-volatility regimes and high-volatility regimes, then generating scenarios using the different means and covariances estimated under the different regimes; and simulating portfolio outcomes (+/− 1 standard deviation) to estimate the likelihood of falling short of the investment objectives. Unconstrained mean–variance optimization (MVO) often leads to portfolios dominated by cash and fixed income at the low-risk end of the spectrum and by private equity at the high-risk end of the spectrum. Some investors impose minimum and maximum constraints on asset classes. Slight changes in the input variables could lead to substantial changes in the asset allocations. Mean–CVaR optimization may be used to identify allocations that minimize downside risk rather than simply volatility. Investors may choose to optimize allocations to risk factors rather than asset classes. These allocations, however, must be implemented using asset classes. Portfolios with similar risk factor exposures can have vastly different asset allocations. Some caveats with respect to risk factor-based allocations are that investors may hold different definitions for a given risk factor, correlations among risk factors may shift under changing market conditions, and some factor sensitivities are very unstable. Cash flow and commitment-pacing models enable investors in private alternatives to better manage their portfolio liquidity and set realistic annual commitment targets to reach the desired asset allocation. An alternative investment program should be monitored relative to the goals established for the alternative investment program, not simply relative to a benchmark. The investor must monitor developments in the relevant markets to ensure that the fundamental thesis underlying the decision to invest remains intact. Two common benchmarking approaches to benchmarking alternative investments—custom index proxies and peer group comparisons—have significant limitations. IRRs are sensitive to the timing of cash flows into and out of the fund: Two managers may have similar portfolios but different return profiles depending on their capital call and distribution schedule. Pricing issues can distort reported returns and the associated risk metrics, such as betas, correlations, and Sharpe ratios. Monitoring of the firm and the investment process are particularly important in alternative investment structures where the manager cannot be terminated easily. Key elements to monitor include key person risk, alignment of interests, style drift, risk management, client/asset turnover, client profile, and service providers.

The reading is organized around a classification of active equity strategies into two broad approaches: fundamental and quantitative. Both approaches aim at outperforming a passive benchmark (for example, a broad equity market index), but they tend to make investment decisions differently. Fundamental approaches stress the use of human judgment in processing information and making investment decisions, whereas quantitative approaches tend to rely more heavily on rules-based quantitative models. As a result, some practitioners and academics refer to the fundamental, judgment-based approaches as “discretionary” and to the rules-based, quantitative approaches as “systematic.” This reading is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces fundamental and quantitative approaches to active management. Section 3 discusses bottom-up, top-down, factor-based, and activist investing strategies. Section 4 describes the process of creating fundamental active investment strategies, including the parameters to consider as well as some of the pitfalls. Section 5 describes the steps required to create quantitative active investment strategies, as well as the pitfalls in a quantitative investment process. Section 6 discusses style classifications of active strategies and the uses and limitations of such classifications. A summary of key points completes the reading.","The member should be able to: compare fundamental and quantitative approaches to active management; analyze bottom-up active strategies, including their rationale and associated processes; analyze top-down active strategies, including their rationale and associated processes; analyze factor-based active strategies, including their rationale and associated processes; analyze activist strategies, including their rationale and associated processes; describe active strategies based on statistical arbitrage and market microstructure; describe how fundamental active investment strategies are created; describe how quantitative active investment strategies are created; discuss equity investment style classifications.","This reading discusses the different approaches to active equity management and describes how the various strategies are created. It also addresses the style classification of active approaches. Active equity management approaches can be generally divided into two groups: fundamental (also referred to as discretionary) and quantitative (also known as systematic or rules-based). Fundamental approaches stress the use of human judgment in arriving at an investment decision, whereas quantitative approaches stress the use of rules-based, quantitative models to arrive at a decision. The main differences between fundamental and quantitative approaches include the following characteristics: approach to the decision-making process (subjective versus objective); forecast focus (stock returns versus factor returns); information used (research versus data); focus of the analysis (depth versus breadth); orientation to the data (forward looking versus backward looking); and approach to portfolio risk (emphasis on judgment versus emphasis on optimization techniques). The main types of active management strategies include bottom-up, top-down, factor-based, and activist. Bottom-up strategies begin at the company level, and use company and industry analyses to assess the intrinsic value of the company and determine whether the stock is undervalued or overvalued relative to its market price. Fundamental managers often focus on one or more of the following company and industry characteristics: business model and branding, competitive advantages, and management and corporate governance. Bottom-up strategies are often divided into value-based approaches and growth-based approaches. Top-down strategies focus on the macroeconomic environment, demographic trends, and government policies to arrive at investment decisions. Top-down strategies are used in several investment decision processes, including the following: country and geographic allocation, sector and industry rotation, equity style rotation, volatility-based strategies, and thematic investment strategies. Quantitative equity investment strategies often use factor-based models. A factor-based strategy aims to identify significant factors that drive stock prices and to construct a portfolio with a positive bias towards such factors. Factors can be grouped based on fundamental characteristics—such as value, growth, and price momentum—or on unconventional data. Activist investors specialize in taking meaningful stakes in listed companies and influencing those companies to make changes to their management, strategy, or capital structures for the purpose of increasing the stock’s value and realizing a gain on their investment. Statistical arbitrage (or “stat arb”) strategies use statistical and technical analysis to exploit pricing anomalies and achieve superior returns. Pairs trading is an example of a popular and simple statistical arbitrage strategy. Event-driven strategies exploit market inefficiencies that may occur around corporate events such as mergers and acquisitions, earnings announcements, bankruptcies, share buybacks, special dividends, and spinoffs. The fundamental active investment process includes the following steps: define the investment universe; prescreen the universe; understand the industry and business; forecast the company’s financial performance; convert forecasts into a target price; construct the portfolio with the desired risk profile; and rebalance the portfolio according to a buy and sell discipline. Pitfalls in fundamental investing include behavioral biases, the value trap, and the growth trap. Behavioral biases can be divided into two groups: cognitive errors and emotional biases. Typical biases that are relevant to active equity management include confirmation bias, illusion of control, availability bias, loss aversion, overconfidence, and regret aversion. The quantitative active investment process includes the following steps: define the investment thesis; acquire, clean, and process the data; backtest the strategy; evaluate the strategy; and construct an efficient portfolio using risk and trading cost models. The pitfalls in quantitative investing include look-ahead and survivorship biases, overfitting, data mining, unrealistic turnover assumptions, transaction costs, and short availability. An investment style generally splits the stock universe into two or three groups, such that each group contains stocks with similar characteristics. The common style characteristics used in active management include value, size, price momentum, volatility, high dividend, and earnings quality. A stock’s membership in an industry, sector, or country group is also used to classify the investment style. Two main approaches are often used in style analysis: a returns-based approach and a holdings-based approach. Holdings-based approaches aggregate the style scores of individual holdings, while returns-based approaches analyze the investment style of portfolio managers by comparing the returns of the strategy to those of a set of style indexes.

A veritable explosion in big data has occurred over the past decade or so, especially in unstructured data generated from social media (e.g., posts, tweets, blogs), email and text communications, web traffic, online news sites, electronic images, and other electronic information sources. The prospects are for exponential growth in big data to continue. Investment managers are increasingly using big data in their investment processes as they strive to discover signals embedded in such data that can provide them with an information edge. They seek to augment structured data with a plethora of unstructured data to develop improved forecasts of trends in asset prices, detect anomalies, etc. A typical example involves a fund manager using financial text data from 10-K reports for forecasting stock sentiment (i.e., positive or negative), which can then be used as an input to a more comprehensive forecasting model that includes corporate financial data. Unlike structured data (numbers and values) that can be readily organized into data tables to be read and analyzed by computers, unstructured data typically require specific methods of preparation and refinement before being usable by machines (i.e., computers) and useful to investment professionals. Given the volume, variety, and velocity of available big data, it is important for portfolio managers and investment analysts to have a basic understanding of how unstructured data can be transformed into structured data suitable as inputs to machine learning (ML) methods (in fact, for any type of modeling methods) that can potentially improve their financial forecasts.

Big data—defined as data with volume, velocity, variety, and potentially lower veracity—has tremendous potential for various fintech applications, including several related to investment management. The main steps for traditional ML model building are conceptualization of the problem, data collection, data preparation and wrangling, data exploration, and model training. For textual ML model building, the first four steps differ somewhat from those used in the traditional model: Text problem formulation, text curation, text preparation and wrangling, and text exploration are typically necessary. For structured data, data preparation and wrangling entail data cleansing and data preprocessing. Data cleansing typically involves resolving incompleteness errors, invalidity errors, inaccuracy errors, inconsistency errors, non-uniformity errors, and duplication errors. Preprocessing for structured data typically involves performing the following transformations: extraction, aggregation, filtration, selection, and conversion. Preparation and wrangling text (unstructured) data involves a set of text-specific cleansing and preprocessing tasks. Text cleansing typically involves removing the following: html tags, punctuations, most numbers, and white spaces. Text preprocessing requires performing normalization that involves the following: lowercasing, removing stop words, stemming, lemmatization, creating bag-of-words (BOW) and n-grams, and organizing the BOW and n-grams into a document term matrix (DTM). Data exploration encompasses exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and feature engineering. Whereas histograms, box plots, and scatterplots are common techniques for exploring structured data, word clouds are an effective way to gain a high-level picture of the composition of textual content. These visualization tools help share knowledge among the team (business subject matter experts, quants, technologists, etc.) to help derive optimal solutions. Feature selection methods used for text data include term frequency, document frequency, chi-square test, and a mutual information measure. Feature engineering for text data includes converting numbers into tokens, creating n-grams, and using name entity recognition and parts of speech to engineer new feature variables. The model training steps (method selection, performance evaluation, and model tuning) often do not differ much for structured versus unstructured data projects. Model selection is governed by the following factors: whether the data project involves labeled data (supervised learning) or unlabeled data (unsupervised learning); the type of data (numerical, continuous, or categorical; text data; image data; speech data; etc.); and the size of the dataset. Model performance evaluation involves error analysis using confusion matrixes, determining receiver operating characteristics, and calculating root mean square error. To carry out an error analysis for each model, a confusion matrix is created; true positives (TPs), true negatives (TNs), false positives (FPs), and false negatives (FNs) are determined. Then, the following performance metrics are calculated: accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall. The higher the accuracy and F1 score, the better the model performance. To carry out receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, ROC curves and area under the curve (AUC) of various models are calculated and compared. The more convex the ROC curve and the higher the AUC, the better the model performance. Model tuning involves managing the trade-off between model bias error, associated with underfitting, and model variance error, associated with overfitting. A fitting curve of in-sample (training sample) error and out-of-sample (cross-validation sample) error on the y-axis versus model complexity on the x-axis is useful for managing the bias vs. variance error trade-off. In a real-world big data project involving text data analysis for classifying and predicting sentiment of financial text for particular stocks, the text data are transformed into structured data for populating the DTM, which is then used as the input for the ML algorithm. To derive term frequency (TF) at the sentence level and TF–IDF, both of which can be inputs to the DTM, the following frequency measures should be used to create a term frequency measures table: TotalWordsInSentence; TotalWordCount; TermFrequency (Collection Level); WordCountInSentence; SentenceCountWithWord; Document Frequency; and Inverse Document Frequency.

https://missingpdf.com/,Equity Investments,2018,Level II,"Common stock represents an ownership interest in a business. A business in its operations generates a stream of cash flows, and as owners of the business, common stockholders have an equity ownership claim on those future cash flows. Beginning with John Burr Williams (1938), analysts have developed this insight into a group of valuation models known as discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation models. DCF models—which view the intrinsic value of common stock as the present value of its expected future cash flows—are a fundamental tool in both investment management and investment research. This reading is the first of several that describe DCF models and address how to apply those models in practice. Although the principles behind discounted cash flow valuation are simple, applying the theory to equity valuation can be challenging. Four broad steps in applying DCF analysis to equity valuation are: choosing the class of DCF model—equivalently, selecting a specific definition of cash flow; forecasting the cash flows; choosing a discount rate methodology; and estimating the discount rate. In this reading, we take the perspective that dividends—distributions to shareholders authorized by a company’s board of directors—are an appropriate definition of cash flows. The class of models based on this idea is called dividend discount models, or DDMs. The basic objective of any DDM is to value a stock. The variety of implementations corresponds to different ways to model a company’s future stream of dividend payments. The steps of choosing a discount rate methodology and estimating the discount rate involve the same considerations for all DCF models, so they have been presented separately in a reading on return concepts. The reading is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of present value models. A general statement of the dividend discount model follows in Section 3. Forecasting dividends, individually and in detail, into the indefinite future is not generally practicable, so the dividend-forecasting problem is usually simplified. One approach is to assign dividends to a stylized growth pattern. The simplest pattern—dividends growing at a constant rate forever—is the constant growth (or Gordon growth) model, discussed in Section 4. For some companies, it is more appropriate to view earnings and dividends as having multiple stages of growth; multistage dividend discount models are presented in Section 5 along with spreadsheet modeling. Section 6 lays out the determinants of dividend growth rates, and the final section summarizes the reading.","The candidate should be able to: compare dividends, free cash flow, and residual income as inputs to discounted cash flow models and identify investment situations for which each measure is suitable; calculate and interpret the value of a common stock using the dividend discount model (DDM) for single and multiple holding periods; calculate the value of a common stock using the Gordon growth model and explain the model’s underlying assumptions; calculate and interpret the implied growth rate of dividends using the Gordon growth model and current stock price; calculate and interpret the present value of growth opportunities (PVGO) and the component of the leading price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) related to PVGO; calculate and interpret the justified leading and trailing P/Es using the Gordon growth model; calculate the value of noncallable fixed-rate perpetual preferred stock; describe strengths and limitations of the Gordon growth model and justify its selection to value a company’s common shares; explain the assumptions and justify the selection of the two-stage DDM, the H-model, the three-stage DDM, or spreadsheet modeling to value a company’s common shares; explain the growth phase, transitional phase, and maturity phase of a business; describe terminal value and explain alternative approaches to determining the terminal value in a DDM; calculate and interpret the value of common shares using the two-stage DDM, the H-model, and the three-stage DDM; estimate a required return based on any DDM, including the Gordon growth model and the H-model; explain the use of spreadsheet modeling to forecast dividends and to value common shares; calculate and interpret the sustainable growth rate of a company and demonstrate the use of DuPont analysis to estimate a company’s sustainable growth rate; evaluate whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued by the market based on a DDM estimate of value.","This reading provided an overview of DCF models of valuation, discussed the estimation of a stock’s required rate of return, and presented in detail the dividend discount model. In DCF models, the value of any asset is the present value of its (expected) future cash flows V 0 = ∑ t = 1 n CF t ( 1 + r ) t where V0 is the value of the asset as of t = 0 (today), CFt is the (expected) cash flow at time t, and r is the discount rate or required rate of return. For infinitely lived assets such as common stocks, n runs to infinity. Several alternative streams of expected cash flows can be used to value equities, including dividends, free cash flow, and residual income. A discounted dividend approach is most suitable for dividend-paying stocks in which the company has a discernible dividend policy that has an understandable relationship to the company’s profitability, and the investor has a noncontrol (minority ownership) perspective. The free cash flow approach (FCFF or FCFE) might be appropriate when the company does not pay dividends, dividends differ substantially from FCFE, free cash flows align with profitability, or the investor takes a control (majority ownership) perspective. The residual income approach can be useful when the company does not pay dividends (as an alternative to a FCF approach) or free cash flow is negative. The DDM with a single holding period gives stock value as V 0 = D 1 ( 1 + r ) 1 + P 1 ( 1 + r ) 1 = D 1 + P 1 ( 1 + r ) 1 where D 1 is the expected dividend at time 1 and V0 is the stock’s (expected) value at time 0. Assuming that V0 is equal to today’s market price, P 0, the expected holding-period return is r = D 1 + P 1 P 0 − 1 = D 1 P 0 + P 1 − P 0 P 0 The expression for the DDM for any given finite holding period n and the gen - eral expression for the DDM are, respectively, V 0 = ∑ t = 1 n D t ( 1 + r ) t + P n ( 1 + r ) n and V 0 = ∑ t = 1 ∞ D t ( 1 + r ) t There are two main approaches to the problem of forecasting dividends. First, an analyst can assign the entire stream of expected future dividends to one of several stylized growth patterns. Second, an analyst can forecast a finite number of dividends individually up to a terminal point and value the remaining divi - dends either by assigning them to a stylized growth pattern or by forecasting share price as of the terminal point of the dividend forecasts. The Gordon growth model assumes that dividends grow at a constant rate g for - ever, so that D t = Dt– 1(1 + g). The dividend stream in the Gordon growth model has a value of V 0 = D 0 ( 1 + g ) r − g , or V 0 = D 1 r − g where r > g The value of noncallable fixed-rate perpetual preferred stock is V0 = D / r, where D is the stock’s (constant) annual dividend. Assuming that price equals value, the Gordon growth model estimate of a stock’s expected rate of return is r = D 0 ( 1 + g ) P 0 + g = D 1 P 0 + g Given an estimate of the next-period dividend and the stock’s required rate of return, the Gordon growth model can be used to estimate the dividend growth rate implied by the current market price (making a constant growth rate assumption). The present value of growth opportunities (PVGO) is the part of a stock’s total value, V0, that comes from profitable future growth opportunities in contrast to the value associated with assets already in place. The relationship is V0 = E 1 / r + PVGO, where E 1 / r is defined as the no-growth value per share. The leading price-to-earnings ratio ( P 0 / E 1) and the trailing price-to-earnings ratio ( P 0 / E 0) can be expressed in terms of the Gordon growth model as, respectively, P 0 E 1 = D 1 / E 1 r − g = 1 − b r − g and P 0 E 0 = D 0 ( 1 + g ) / E 0 r − g = ( 1 − b ) ( 1 + g ) r − g The above expressions give a stock’s justified price-to-earnings ratio based on forecasts of fundamentals (given that the Gordon growth model is appropriate). The Gordon growth model may be useful for valuing broad-based equity indexes and the stock of businesses with earnings that are expected to grow at a stable rate comparable to or lower than the nominal growth rate of the economy. Gordon growth model values are very sensitive to the assumed growth rate and required rate of return. For many companies, growth falls into phases. In the growth phase, a company enjoys an abnormally high growth rate in earnings per share, called super - normal growth. In the transition phase, earnings growth slows. In the mature phase, the company reaches an equilibrium in which such factors as earnings growth and the return on equity stabilize at levels that can be sustained long term. Analysts often apply multistage DCF models to value the stock of a company with multistage growth prospects. The two-stage dividend discount model assumes different growth rates in Stage 1 and Stage 2 V 0 = ∑ t = 1 n D 0 ( 1 + g S ) t ( 1 + r ) t + D 0 ( 1 + g S ) n ( 1 + g L ) ( 1 + r ) n ( r − g L ) where gS is the expected dividend growth rate in the first period and gL is the expected growth rate in the second period. The terminal stock value, Vn, is sometimes found with the Gordon growth model or with some other method, such as applying a P/E multiplier to forecasted EPS as of the terminal date. The H-model assumes that the dividend growth rate declines linearly from a high supernormal rate to the normal growth rate during Stage 1, and then grows at a constant normal growth rate thereafter: V 0 = D 0 ( 1 + g L ) r − g L + D 0 H ( g S − g L ) r − g L = D 0 ( 1 + g L ) + D 0 H ( g S − g L ) r − g L There are two basic three-stage models. In one version, the growth rate in the middle stage is constant. In the second version, the growth rate declines linearly in Stage 2 and becomes constant and normal in Stage 3. Spreadsheet models are very flexible, providing the analyst with the ability to value any pattern of expected dividends. In addition to valuing equities, the IRR of a DDM, assuming assets are correctly priced in the marketplace, has been used to estimate required returns. For simpler models (such as the one-period model, the Gordon growth model, and the H-model), well-known formulas may be used to calculate these rates of return. For many dividend streams, however, the rate of return must be found by trial and error, producing a discount rate that equates the present value of the forecasted dividend stream to the current market price. Multistage DDM models can accommodate a wide variety of patterns of expected dividends. Even though such models may use stylized assumptions about growth, they can provide useful approximations. Dividend growth rates can be obtained from analyst forecasts, statistical forecasting models, or company fundamentals. The sustainable growth rate depends on the ROE and the earnings retention rate, b: g = b × ROE. This expression can be expanded further, using the DuPont formula, as g = Net income − Dividends Net income × Net income Sales × Sales Total assets × Total assets Shareholders' equity

https://missingpdf.com/,Corporate Finance,2020,Level I,"A company grows by making investments that are expected to increase revenues and profits. The company acquires the capital or funds necessary to make such investments by borrowing or using funds from owners. By applying this capital to investments with long-term benefits, the company is producing value today. But, how much value? The answer depends not only on the investments’ expected future cash flows but also on the cost of the funds. Borrowing is not costless. Neither is using owners’ funds. The cost of this capital is an important ingredient in both investment decision making by the company’s management and the valuation of the company by investors. If a company invests in projects that produce a return in excess of the cost of capital, the company has created value; in contrast, if the company invests in projects whose returns are less than the cost of capital, the company has actually destroyed value. Therefore, the estimation of the cost of capital is a central issue in corporate financial management. For the analyst seeking to evaluate a company’s investment program and its competitive position, an accurate estimate of a company’s cost of capital is important as well. Cost of capital estimation is a challenging task. As we have already implied, the cost of capital is not observable but, rather, must be estimated. Arriving at a cost of capital estimate requires a host of assumptions and estimates. Another challenge is that the cost of capital that is appropriately applied to a specific investment depends on the characteristics of that investment: The riskier the investment’s cash flows, the greater its cost of capital. In reality, a company must estimate project-specific costs of capital. What is often done, however, is to estimate the cost of capital for the company as a whole and then adjust this overall corporate cost of capital upward or downward to reflect the risk of the contemplated project relative to the company’s average project. This reading is organized as follows: In the next section, we introduce the cost of capital and its basic computation. Section 3 presents a selection of methods for estimating the costs of the various sources of capital. Section 4 discusses issues an analyst faces in using the cost of capital. A summary concludes the reading.","The member should be able to: calculate and interpret the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of a company; describe how taxes affect the cost of capital from different capital sources; describe the use of target capital structure in estimating WACC and how target capital structure weights may be determined; explain how the marginal cost of capital and the investment opportunity schedule are used to determine the optimal capital budget; explain the marginal cost of capital’s role in determining the net present value of a project; calculate and interpret the cost of debt capital using the yield-to-maturity approach and the debt-rating approach; calculate and interpret the cost of noncallable, nonconvertible preferred stock; calculate and interpret the cost of equity capital using the capital asset pricing model approach, the dividend discount model approach, and the bond-yield-plus risk-premium approach; calculate and interpret the beta and cost of capital for a project; describe uses of country risk premiums in estimating the cost of equity; describe the marginal cost of capital schedule, explain why it may be upward-sloping with respect to additional capital, and calculate and interpret its break-points; explain and demonstrate the correct treatment of flotation costs.","In this reading, we provided an overview of the techniques used to calculate the cost of capital for companies and projects. We examined the weighted average cost of capital, discussing the methods commonly used to estimate the component costs of capital and the weights applied to these components. The international dimension of the cost of capital, as well as key factors influencing the cost of capital, were also analyzed. The weighted average cost of capital is a weighted average of the after-tax marginal costs of each source of capital: WACC = w d r d (1 – t ) + w p r p + w e r e An analyst uses the WACC in valuation. For example, the WACC is used to value a project using the net present value method: NPV = Present value of inflows – Present value of the outflows The before-tax cost of debt is generally estimated by means of one of the two methods: yield to maturity or bond rating. The yield-to-maturity method of estimating the before-tax cost of debt uses the familiar bond valuation equation. Assuming semi-annual coupon payments, the equation is P 0 = P M T 1 ( 1 + r d 2 ) + … + P M T n ( 1 + r d 2 ) n + F V ( 1 + r d 2 ) n = ( ∑ t = 1 n P M T t ( 1 + r d 2 ) t ) + F V ( 1 + r d 2 ) n We solve for the six-month yield ( r d /2) and then annualize it to arrive at the before-tax cost of debt, r d . Because interest payments are generally tax-deductible, the after-tax cost is the true, effective cost of debt to the company. If a current yield or bond rating is not available, such as in the case of a private company without rated debt or a project, the estimate of the cost of debt becomes more challenging. The cost of preferred stock is the preferred stock dividend divided by the current preferred stock price: r p = D p P p The cost of equity is the rate of return required by a company’s common stockholders. We estimate this cost using the CAPM (or its variants) or the dividend discount method. The CAPM is the approach most commonly used to calculate the cost of common stock. The three components needed to calculate the cost of common stock are the risk-free rate, the equity risk premium, and beta: E ( R i ) = R F + β i [ E ( R M ) − R F ] When estimating the cost of equity capital using the CAPM when we do not have publicly traded equity, we may be able to use the pure-play method in which we estimate the unlevered beta for a company with similar business risk, β U , β U,comparable = β L,comparable [ 1 + ( ( 1 − t comparable ) D comparable E comparable ) ] and then lever this beta to reflect the financial risk of the project or company: β L,project = β U,comparable [ 1 + ( ( 1 − t project ) D project E project ) ] It is often the case that country and foreign exchange risk are diversified so that we can use the estimated β in the CAPM analysis. However, in the case in which these risks cannot be diversified away, we can adjust our measure of systematic risk by a country equity premium to reflect this nondiversified risk: Country equity premium = Sovereign yield spread [ Annualized standard deviation of equity index Annualized standard deviation of the sovereign bond market in terms of the developed market currency ] The dividend discount model approach is an alternative approach to calculating the cost of equity, whereby the cost of equity is estimated as follows: r e = D 1 P 0 + g We can estimate the growth rate in the dividend discount model by using published forecasts of analysts or by estimating the sustainable growth rate: g = ( 1 − D / EPS ) ROE In estimating the cost of equity, an alternative to the CAPM and dividend discount approaches is the bond yield plus risk premium approach. In this approach, we estimate the before-tax cost of debt and add a risk premium that reflects the additional risk associated with the company’s equity. The marginal cost of capital schedule is a graph plotting the new funds raised by a company on the x -axis and the cost of capital on the y -axis. The cost of capital is level to the point at which one of the costs of capital changes, such as when the company bumps up against a debt covenant, requiring it to use another form of capital. We calculate a break point using information on when the different sources’ costs change and the proportions that the company uses when it raises additional capital: Break point = Amount of capital at which the source's cost of capital changes Proportion of new capital raised from the source Flotation costs are costs incurred in the process of raising additional capital. The preferred method of including these costs in the analysis is as an initial cash flow in the valuation analysis. Survey evidence tells us that the CAPM method is the most popular method used by companies in estimating the cost of equity. The CAPM is more popular with larger, publicly traded companies, which is understandable considering the additional analyses and assumptions required in estimating systematic risk for a private company or project.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2020/pdf/exchange-traded-funds-mechanics-applications.pdf,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,2020,Level II,"Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have grown rapidly since their invention in the early 1990s, in large part because of their low associated cost, exchange access, holdings transparency, and range of asset classes available. Growth in ETFs has also been driven by the increased use of index-based investing. ETF investors need to understand how these products work and trade and how to choose from the numerous options available. Although many ETFs are organized under the same regulation as mutual fund products, there are important differences related to trading and tax efficiency. ETFs have features that can make them more tax efficient than traditional mutual funds, and not all ETFs are organized like mutual funds. ETFs can be based on derivative strategies, use leverage and shorting, and be offered in alternate structures, such as exchange-traded notes (ETNs), which have their own unique risks. Understanding how ETF shares are created and redeemed is key to understanding how these products can add value in a portfolio. Since so many ETFs track indexes, understanding their index tracking or tracking error is also critical. Investors should also understand how to assess an ETF’s trading costs, including differences between the ETF’s market price and the fair value of its portfolio holdings. This reading is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses ETF primary and secondary markets, including the creation/redemption process. Section 3 covers important investor considerations, such as costs and risks, when choosing an ETF. Section 4 explains how ETFs are used in strategic, tactical, and portfolio efficiency applications. Section 5 concludes and summarizes the reading.",The member should be able to: explain the creation/redemption process of ETFs and the function of authorized participants; describe how ETFs are traded in secondary markets; describe sources of tracking error for ETFs; describe factors affecting ETF bid–ask spreads; describe sources of ETF premiums and discounts to NAV; describe costs of owning an ETF; describe types of ETF risk; identify and describe portfolio uses of ETFs.,"In this reading, we have examined important considerations for ETF investors, including how ETFs work and trade, tax efficient attributes, and key portfolio uses. The following is a summary of key points: ETFs rely on a creation/redemption mechanism that allows for the continuous creation and redemption of ETF shares. The only investors who can create or redeem new ETF shares are a special group of institutional investors called authorized participants. ETFs trade on both the primary market (directly between APs and issuers) and on the secondary markets (exchange-based or over-the-counter trades like listed equity). End investors trade ETFs on the secondary markets, like stocks. Holding period performance deviations (tracking differences) are more useful than the standard deviation of daily return differences (tracking error). ETF tracking differences from the index occur for the following reasons: fees and expenses, representative sampling/optimization, use of depositary receipts and other ETFs, index changes, fund accounting practices, regulatory and tax requirements, and asset manager operations. ETFs are generally taxed like the securities they hold, with some nuances: ETFs are more tax fair than traditional mutual funds, because portfolio trading is generally not required when money enters or exits an ETF. Owing to the creation/redemption process, ETFs can be more tax efficient than mutual funds. ETF issuers can redeem out low-cost-basis securities to minimize future taxable gains. Local markets have unique ETF taxation issues that should be considered. ETF bid–ask spreads vary by trade size and are usually published for smaller trade sizes. They are tightest for ETFs that are very liquid and have continuous two-way order flow. For less liquid ETFs, the following factors can determine the quoted bid–ask spread of an ETF trade: Creation/redemption costs, brokerage and exchange fees Bid–ask spread of underlying securities held by the ETF Risk of hedging or carry positions by liquidity provider Market makers’ target profit spread ETF bid–ask spreads on fixed income relative to equity tend to be wider because the underlying bonds trade in dealer markets and hedging is more difficult. Spreads on ETFs holding international stocks are tightest when the underlying security markets are open for trading. ETF premiums and discounts refer to the difference between the exchange price of the ETF and the fund’s calculated NAV, based on the prices of the underlying securities and weighted by the portfolio positions at the start of each trading day. Premiums and discounts can occur because NAVs are based on the last traded prices, which may be observed at a time lag to the ETF price, or because the ETF is more liquid and more reflective of current information and supply and demand than the underlying securities in rapidly changing markets. Costs of ETF ownership may be positive or negative and include both explicit and implicit costs. The main components of ETF cost are the fund management fee; tracking error; portfolio turnover; trading costs, such as commissions, bid–ask spreads, and premiums/discounts; taxable gains/losses; and security lending. Trading costs are incurred when the position is entered and exited. These one-time costs decrease as a portion of total holding costs over longer holding periods and are a more significant consideration for shorter-term tactical ETF traders. Other costs, such as management fees and portfolio turnover, increase as a proportion of overall cost as the investor holding period lengthens. These costs are a more significant consideration for longer-term buy-and-hold investors. ETFs are different from exchange-traded notes, although both use the creation/redemption process. Exchange-traded notes carry unique counterparty risks of default. Swap-based ETFs may carry counterparty risk. ETFs, like mutual funds, may lend their securities, creating risk of counterparty default. ETF closures can create unexpected tax liabilities. ETFs are used for core asset class exposure, multi-asset, dynamic, and tactical strategies based on investment views or changing market conditions; for factor or smart beta strategies with a goal to improve return or modify portfolio risk; and for portfolio efficiency applications, such as rebalancing, liquidity management, completion strategies, and transitions. ETFs are useful for investing cash inflows, as well as for raising proceeds to provide for client withdrawals. ETFs are used for rebalancing to target asset class weights and for “completion strategies” to fill a temporary gap in an asset class category, sector, or investment theme or when external managers are underweight. When positions are in transition from one external manager to another, ETFs are often used as the temporary holding and may be used to fund the new manager. All types of investors use ETFs to establish low-cost core exposure to asset classes, equity style benchmarks, fixed-income categories, and commodities. For more tactical investing, thematic ETFs are used in active portfolio management and represent narrow or niche areas of the equity market not well represented by industry or sector ETFs. Systematic, active strategies that use rules-based benchmarks for exposure to such factors as size, value, momentum, quality, or dividend tilts or combinations of these factors are frequently implemented with ETFs. Multi-asset and global asset allocation or macro strategies that manage positions dynamically as market conditions change are also areas where ETFs are frequently used. Proper utilization requires investors to carefully research and assess the ETF’s index construction methodology, costs, risks, and performance history.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2020/pdf/evaluation-quality-financial-reports.pdf,Financial Reporting and Analysis,2020,Level II,"The ability to assess the quality of reported financial information can be a valuable skill. An analyst or investor who can recognize high-quality financial reporting can have greater confidence in analysis based on those financial reports and the resulting investment decisions. Similarly, an analyst or investor who can recognize poor financial reporting quality early—before deficiencies become widely known—is more likely to make profitable investment decisions or to reduce or even avoid losses. An example of early recognition of an ultimate financial disaster is James Chanos’ short position in Enron in November 2000—more than a year before Enron filed for bankruptcy protection (in December 2001). Despite Enron’s high profile and reputation, Chanos had a negative view of Enron based on both quantitative and qualitative factors. Chanos noted that Enron’s return on capital was both lower than comparable companies’ return on capital and lower than the company’s own cost of capital. Qualitative factors contributing to Chanos’ view included the company’s aggressive revenue recognition policy, its complex and difficult-to-understand disclosures on related-party transactions, and one-time earnings-boosting gains. Later events that substantiated Chanos’ perspective included sales of the company’s stock by insiders and the resignation of senior executives. Another example of early recognition of eventual financial troubles is June 2001 reports by analyst Enitan Adebonojo. These reports highlighted questionable accounting by Royal Ahold, a European food retailer. The questionable accounting included “claiming profits of acquired firms as ‘organic growth,’ booking capital gains from sale-and-leaseback deals as profit, and keeping billions in debt off its balance sheet.” In 2003, Royal Ahold announced that it had significantly overstated its profits in the prior two years. The CEO and CFO resigned, various regulators announced investigations, and Royal Ahold’s market value dropped significantly. This reading focuses on reporting quality and the interrelated attribute of results quality. Reporting quality pertains to the information disclosed in financial reports. High-quality reporting provides decision-useful information—information that is relevant and faithfully represents the economic reality of the company’s activities during the reporting period and the company’s financial condition at the end of the period. A separate, but interrelated, attribute of quality is results or earnings quality , which pertains to the earnings and cash generated by the company’s actual economic activities and the resulting financial condition relative to expectations of current and future financial performance. Note that the term “earnings quality” is more commonly used in practice than “results quality,” so throughout this reading, earnings quality is used broadly to encompass the quality of earnings, cash flow, and/or balance sheet items. High-quality earnings reflect an adequate level of return on investment and are derived from activities that a company will likely be able to sustain in the future. Thus, high-quality earnings increase the value of a company more than low-quality earnings. When reported earnings are described as being high quality, it means that the company’s underlying economic performance was good (i.e., value enhancing), and it also implies that the company had high reporting quality (i.e., that the information that the company calculated and disclosed was a good reflection of the economic reality). Earnings can be termed “low quality” either because the reported information properly represents genuinely bad performance or because the reported information misrepresents economic reality. In theory, a company could have low-quality earnings while simultaneously having high reporting quality. Consider a company with low-quality earnings—for example, one whose only source of earnings in a period is a one-off settlement of a lawsuit without which the company would have reported huge losses. The company could nonetheless have high reporting quality if it calculated its results properly and provided decision-useful information. Although it is theoretically possible that a company could have low-quality earnings while simultaneously having high reporting quality, experiencing poor financial performance can motivate the company’s management to misreport. This reading begins in Section 2 with a description of a conceptual framework for and potential problems with financial reporting quality. This is followed in Section 3 with a discussion of how to evaluate financial reporting quality. Sections 4, 5, and 6 focus on the quality of reported earnings, cash flows, and balance sheets, respectively. Section 7 covers sources of information about risk.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2020/pdf/big-data-projects.pdf,Quantitative Methods,2020,Level II,"Big data (also referred to as alternative data) encompasses data generated by financial markets (e.g., stock and bond prices), businesses (e.g., company financials, production volumes), governments (e.g., economic and trade data), individuals (e.g., credit card purchases, social media posts), sensors (e.g., satellite imagery, traffic patterns), and the Internet of Things, or IoT, (i.e., the network of interrelated digital devices that can transfer data among themselves without human interaction). A veritable explosion in big data has occurred over the past decade or so, especially in unstructured data generated from social media (e.g., posts, tweets, blogs), email and text communications, web traffic, online news sites, electronic images, and other electronic information sources. The prospects are for exponential growth in big data to continue. Investment managers are increasingly using big data in their investment processes as they strive to discover signals embedded in such data that can provide them with an information edge. They seek to augment structured data with a plethora of unstructured data to develop improved forecasts of trends in asset prices, detect anomalies, etc. A typical example involves a fund manager using financial text data from 10-K reports for forecasting stock sentiment (i.e., positive or negative), which can then be used as an input to a more comprehensive forecasting model that includes corporate financial data. Unlike structured data (numbers and values) that can be readily organized into data tables to be read and analyzed by computers, unstructured data typically require specific methods of preparation and refinement before being usable by machines (i.e., computers) and useful to investment professionals. Given the volume, variety, and velocity of available big data, it is important for portfolio managers and investment analysts to have a basic understanding of how unstructured data can be transformed into structured data suitable as inputs to machine learning (ML) methods (in fact, for any type of modeling methods) that can potentially improve their financial forecasts. This reading describes the steps in using big data, both structured and unstructured, in financial forecasting. The concepts and methods are then demonstrated in a case study of an actual big data project. The project uses text-based data derived from financial documents to train an ML model to classify text into positive or negative sentiment classes for the respective stocks and then to predict sentiment. Section 2 of the reading covers a description of the key characteristics of big data. Section 3 provides an overview of the steps in executing a financial forecasting project using big data. We then describe in Sections 4–6 key aspects of data preparation and wrangling, data exploration, and model training using structured data and unstructured (textual) data. In Section 7, we bring these pieces together by covering the execution of an actual big data project. A summary in Section 8 concludes the reading.","The member should be able to: state and explain steps in a data analysis project; describe objectives, steps, and examples of preparing and wrangling data; describe objectives, methods, and examples of data exploration; describe objectives, steps, and techniques in model training; describe preparing, wrangling, and exploring text-based data for financial forecasting; describe methods for extracting, selecting and engineering features from textual data; evaluate the fit of a machine learning algorithm.","In this reading, we have discussed the major steps in big data projects involving the development of machine learning (ML) models—namely, those combining textual big data with structured inputs. Big data—defined as data with volume, velocity, variety, and potentially lower veracity—has tremendous potential for various fintech applications, including several related to investment management. The main steps for traditional ML model building are conceptualization of the problem, data collection, data preparation and wrangling, data exploration, and model training. For textual ML model building, the first four steps differ somewhat from those used in the traditional model: Text problem formulation, text curation, text preparation and wrangling, and text exploration are typically necessary. For structured data, data preparation and wrangling entail data cleansing and data preprocessing. Data cleansing typically involves resolving incompleteness errors, invalidity errors, inaccuracy errors, inconsistency errors, non-uniformity errors, and duplication errors. Preprocessing for structured data typically involves performing the following transformations: extraction, aggregation, filtration, selection, and conversion. Preparation and wrangling text (unstructured) data involves a set of text-specific cleansing and preprocessing tasks. Text cleansing typically involves removing the following: html tags, punctuations, most numbers, and white spaces. Text preprocessing requires performing normalization that involves the following: lowercasing, removing stop words, stemming, lemmatization, creating bag-of-words (BOW) and n-grams, and organizing the BOW and n-grams into a document term matrix (DTM). Data exploration encompasses exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and feature engineering. Whereas histograms, box plots, and scatterplots are common techniques for exploring structured data, word clouds are an effective way to gain a high-level picture of the composition of textual content. These visualization tools help share knowledge among the team (business subject matter experts, quants, technologists, etc.) to help derive optimal solutions. Feature selection methods used for text data include term frequency, document frequency, chi-square test, and a mutual information measure. Feature engineering for text data includes converting numbers into tokens, creating n-grams, and using name entity recognition and parts of speech to engineer new feature variables. The model training steps (method selection, performance evaluation, and model tuning) often do not differ much for structured versus unstructured data projects. Model selection is governed by the following factors: whether the data project involves labeled data (supervised learning) or unlabeled data (unsupervised learning); the type of data (numerical, continuous, or categorical; text data; image data; speech data; etc.); and the size of the dataset. Model performance evaluation involves error analysis using confusion matrixes, determining receiver operating characteristics, and calculating root mean square error. To carry out an error analysis for each model, a confusion matrix is created; true positives (TPs), true negatives (TNs), false positives (FPs), and false negatives (FNs) are determined. Then, the following performance metrics are calculated: accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall. The higher the accuracy and F1 score, the better the model performance. To carry out receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, ROC curves and area under the curve (AUC) of various models are calculated and compared. The more convex the ROC curve and the higher the AUC, the better the model performance. Model tuning involves managing the trade-off between model bias error, associated with underfitting, and model variance error, associated with overfitting. A fitting curve of in-sample (training sample) error and out-of-sample (cross-validation sample) error on the y-axis versus model complexity on the x-axis is useful for managing the bias vs. variance error trade-off. In a real-world big data project involving text data analysis for classifying and predicting sentiment of financial text for particular stocks, the text data are transformed into structured data for populating the DTM, which is then used as the input for the ML algorithm. To derive term frequency (TF) at the sentence level and TF–IDF, both of which can be inputs to the DTM, the following frequency measures should be used to create a term frequency measures table: TotalWordsInSentence; TotalWordCount; TermFrequency (Collection Level); WordCountInSentence; SentenceCountWithWord; Document Frequency; and Inverse Document Frequency.

https://missingpdf.com/,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,2018,Level II,"In setting out to master the concepts and tools of portfolio management, we first need a coherent description of the portfolio management process. The portfolio management process is an integrated set of steps undertaken in a consistent manner to create and maintain an appropriate portfolio (combination of assets) to meet clients’ stated goals. The process we present in this reading is a distillation of the shared elements of current practice. Because it serves as the foundation for the process, we also introduce the investment policy statement through a discussion of its main components. An investment policy statement (IPS) is a written document that clearly sets out a client’s return objectives and risk tolerance over that client’s relevant time horizon, along with applicable constraints such as liquidity needs, tax considerations, regulatory requirements, and unique circumstances. The portfolio management process moves from planning, through execution, and then to feedback. In the planning step, investment objectives and policies are formulated, capital market expectations are formed, and strategic asset allocations are established. In the execution step, the portfolio manager constructs the portfolio. In the feedback step, the manager monitors and evaluates the portfolio compared with the plan. Any changes suggested by the feedback must be examined carefully to ensure that they represent long-run considerations. The investment policy statement provides the foundation of the portfolio management process. In creating an IPS, the manager writes down the client’s special characteristics and needs. The IPS must clearly communicate the client’s objectives and constraints. The IPS thereby becomes a plan that can be executed by any advisor or portfolio manager the client might subsequently hire. A properly developed IPS disciplines the portfolio management process and helps ensure against ad hoc revisions in strategy. When combined with capital market expectations, the IPS forms the basis for a strategic asset allocation. Capital market expectations concern the risk and return characteristics of capital market instruments such as stocks and bonds. The strategic asset allocation establishes acceptable exposures to IPS-permissible asset classes to achieve the client’s long-run objectives and constraints. The portfolio perspective underlies the portfolio management process and IPS. The next sections illustrate this perspective.","The candidate should be able to: explain the importance of the portfolio perspective; describe the steps of the portfolio management process and the components of those steps; explain the role of the investment policy statement in the portfolio management process and describe the elements of an investment policy statement; explain how capital market expectations and the investment policy statement help influence the strategic asset allocation decision and how an investor’s investment time horizon may influence the investor’s strategic asset allocation; define investment objectives and constraints and explain and distinguish among the types of investment objectives and constraints; contrast the types of investment time horizons, determine the time horizon for a particular investor, and evaluate the effects of this time horizon on portfolio choice; justify ethical conduct as a requirement for managing investment portfolios.","In this reading, we have presented the portfolio management process and the elements of the investment policy statement. According to the portfolio perspective, individual investments should be judged in the context of how much risk they add to a portfolio rather than on how risky they are on a stand-alone basis. The three steps in the portfolio management process are the planning step (objectives and constraint determination, investment policy statement creation, capital market expectation formation, and strategic asset allocation creation); the execution step (portfolio selection/composition and portfolio implementation); and the feedback step (performance evaluation and portfolio monitoring and rebalancing). Investment objectives are specific and measurable desired performance outcomes, and constraints are limitations on the ability to make use of particular investments. The two types of objectives are risk and return. The two types of constraints are internal (posed by the characteristics of the investor) and external (imposed by outside agencies). An investment policy statement is a written planning document that governs all investment decisions for the client. This document integrates a client’s needs, preferences, and circumstances into a statement of that client’s objectives and constraints. A policy or strategic asset allocation establishes exposures to IPS-permissible asset classes in a manner designed to satisfy the client’s long-run objectives and constraints. The plan reflects the interaction of objectives and constraints with long-run capital market expectations. In a passive investment strategy approach, portfolio composition does not react to changes in expectations; an example is indexing, which involves a fixed portfolio designed to replicate the returns on an index. An active approach involves holding a portfolio different from a benchmark or comparison portfolio for the purpose of producing positive excess risk-adjusted returns. A semiactive approach refers to an indexing approach with controlled use of weights different from the benchmark. The portfolio selection/composition decision concerns portfolio construction and often uses portfolio optimization to combine assets efficiently to achieve return and risk objectives. The portfolio implementation decision concerns the trading desk function of implementing portfolio decisions and involves explicit and implicit transaction costs. The elements of performance evaluation are performance measurement, attribution, and appraisal. Performance measurement is the calculation of portfolio rates of return. Performance attribution is the analysis of those rates of return to determine the factors that explain how the return was achieved. Performance appraisal assesses how well the portfolio manager performed on a risk-adjusted basis, whether absolute or relative to a benchmark. Portfolio monitoring and rebalancing use feedback to manage ongoing exposures to available investment opportunities in order to continually satisfy the client’s current objectives and constraints. Portfolio management is an ongoing process in which the investment objectives and constraints are identified and specified, investment policies and strategies are developed, the portfolio composition is decided in detail, portfolio decisions are initiated by portfolio managers and implemented by traders, portfolio performance is evaluated, investor and market conditions are monitored, and any necessary rebalancing is implemented. To determine a risk objective, there are several steps: specify a risk measure (or measures) such as standard deviation, determine the investor’s willingness to take risk, determine the investor’s ability to take risk, synthesize the investor’s willingness and ability into the investor’s risk tolerance, and specify an objective using the measure(s) in the first step above. To determine a return objective, there are several steps: specify a return measure such as total nominal return, determine the investor’s stated return desire, determine the investor’s required rate of return, and specify an objective in terms of the return measure in the first step above. A liquidity requirement is a need for cash in excess of the contribution rate or the savings rate at a specified point in time. This need may be either anticipated or unanticipated. A time horizon is the time period associated with an investment objective. Investment objectives and associated time horizons may be short term, long term, or a combination of these two. A multistage horizon is a combination of shorter term and longer term horizons. A time horizon can be considered a constraint because shorter time horizons generally indicate lower risk tolerance and hence constrain portfolio choice, making it more conservative. A tax concern is any issue arising from a tax structure that reduces the amount of the total return that can be used for current needs or reinvested for future growth. Tax concerns constrain portfolio choice. If differences exist between the tax rates applying to investment income and capital gains, tax considerations will influence the choice of investment. Legal and regulatory factors are external considerations that may constrain investment decision making. For example, a government agency may limit the use of certain asset classes in retirement portfolios. Unique circumstances are internal factors (other than a liquidity requirement, time horizon, or tax concerns) that may constrain portfolio choices. For example, an investor seeking to avoid investments in tobacco companies will place an internal constraint on portfolio choice.

REITs were initially conceived of as a way for small investors to gain exposure to a professionally managed, diversified real estate portfolio. REITs were viewed as a type of (closed-end) mutual fund and income passthrough vehicle through which the portfolio manager would acquire attractively valued properties, occasionally sell fully valued properties, and distribute property earnings to the trust’s investors. Legislation was passed in the United States in 1960 to authorize REITs, and the Netherlands followed suit in 1969. The US model and other types of tax-advantaged real estate investment vehicles have been adopted worldwide. The S&P 500 Index added REITs as a separate GICS sector in 2016. As of October 2020, more than 35 countries have REITs or REIT-like structures, more are considering adopting similar vehicles, and REITs are held by individuals and institutions alike.","The member should be able to: discuss types of publicly traded real estate securities justify the use of net asset value per share (NAVPS) in valuation of publicly traded real estate securities and estimate NAVPS based on forecasted cash net operating income describe the use of funds from operations (FFO) and adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) in REIT valuation calculate and interpret the value of a REIT share using the net asset value, relative value (price-to-FFO and price-to-AFFO), and discounted cash flow approaches explain advantages and disadvantages of investing in real estate through publicly traded securities compared to private vehicles","The principal types of publicly traded real estate securities include real estate investment trusts (REITs), real estate operating companies (REOCs), and residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities (RMBS and CMBS). Compared with other publicly traded shares, REITs typically offer higher-than-average yields and greater stability of income and returns. They are amenable to a net asset value approach to valuation because of the existence of active private markets for their real estate assets. Compared with REOCs, REITs offer higher yields and income tax exemptions but have less operating flexibility to invest in a broad range of real estate activities and less potential for growth from reinvesting their operating cash flows because of their high income-to-payout ratios. In assessing the investment merits of REITs, investors analyze the effects of trends in general economic activity, retail sales, job creation, population growth, and new supply and demand for specific types of space. Investors also pay particular attention to occupancies, leasing activity, rental rates, remaining lease terms, in-place rents compared with market rents, costs to maintain space and re-lease space, tenants’ financial health and tenant concentration in the portfolio, financial leverage, debt maturities and costs, and the quality of management and governance. Analysts make adjustments to the historical cost-based financial statements of REITs and REOCs to obtain better measures of current income and net worth. The three principal figures they calculate and use are (1) funds from operations or accounting net earnings, excluding depreciation, deferred tax charges, and gains or losses on sales of property and debt restructuring; (2) adjusted funds from operations, or funds from operations adjusted to remove straight-line rent and to provide for maintenance-type capital expenditures and leasing costs, including leasing agents’ commissions and tenants’ improvement allowances; and (3) net asset value or the difference between a real estate company’s asset and liability ranking prior to shareholders’ equity, all valued at market values instead of accounting book values. REITs and some REOCs generally return a significant portion of their income to their investors as required by law and, as a result, tend to pay high dividends. Thus, dividend discount or discounted cash flow models for valuation are also applicable. These valuation approaches are applied in the same manner as they are for shares in other industries. Usually, investors use two- or three-step dividend discount models with near-term, intermediate-term, and/or long-term growth assumptions. In discounted cash flow models, investors often use intermediate-term cash flow projections and a terminal value based on historical cash flow multiples.

https://missingpdf.com/,Financial Reporting and Analysis,2018,Level III,"This reading covers two complex aspects of employee compensation: post- employment (retirement) benefits and share- based compensation. Retirement benefits include pensions and other post- employment benefits, such as health insurance. Examples of share- based compensation are stock options and stock grants. A common issue underlying both of these aspects of employee compensation is the difficulty in measuring the value of the compensation. One factor contributing to the difficulty is that employees earn the benefits in the periods that they provide service but typically receive the benefits in future periods, so measurement requires a significant number of assumptions. This reading provides an overview of the methods companies use to estimate and measure the benefits they provide to their employees and how this informa-tion is reported in financial statements. There has been some convergence between International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and US generally accepted account-ing principles (US GAAP) in the measurement and accounting treatment for pensions, other post- employment benefits, and share- based compensation, but some differences remain. Although this reading focuses on IFRS as the basis for discussion, instances where US GAAP significantly differ are discussed. The reading is organized as follows: Section 2 addresses pensions and other post-employment benefits, and Section 3 covers share- based compensation with a primary focus on the accounting for and analysis of stock options. A summary and practice problems conclude the reading.","The candidate should be able to: a. describe the types of post-employment benefit plans and implications for financial reports; b. explain and calculate measures of a defined benefit pension obligation (i.e., present value of the defined benefit obligation and projected benefit obligation) and net pension liability (or asset); c. describe the components of a company’s defined benefit pension costs; d. explain and calculate the effect of a defined benefit plan’s assumptions on the defined benefit obligation and periodic pension cost; e. explain and calculate how adjusting for items of pension and other post- employment benefits that are reported in the notes to the financial statements affects financial statements and ratios; f. interpret pension plan note disclosures including cash flow related information; g. explain issues associated with accounting for share based compensation; h. explain how accounting for stock grants and stock options affects financial statements, and the importance of companies’ assumptions in valuing these grants and options.","This reading discussed two different forms of employee compensation: post employment benefits and share based compensation. Although different, the two are similar in that they are forms of compensation outside of the standard salary arrangements. They also involve complex valuation, accounting, and reporting issues. Although IFRS and US GAAP are converging on accounting and reporting, it is important to note that differences in a country’s social system, laws, and regulations can result in differences in a company’s pension and share based\ compensation plans that may be reflected in the company’s earnings and financial reports. Key points include the following: Defined contribution pension plans specify (define) only the amount of contribution to the plan; the eventual amount of the pension benefit to the employee will depend on the value of an employee’s plan assets at the time of retirement. Balance sheet reporting is less analytically relevant for defined contribution plans because companies make contributions to defined contribution plans as the expense arises and thus no liabilities accrue for that type of plan. Defined benefit pension plans specify (define) the amount of the pension benefit, often determined by a plan formula, under which the eventual amount of the benefit to the employee is a function of length of service and final salary. Defined benefit pension plan obligations are funded by the sponsoring company contributing assets to a pension trust, a separate legal entity. Differences exist in countries’ regulatory requirements for companies to fund defined benefit pension plan obligations. Both IFRS and US GAAP require companies to report on their balance sheet a pension liability or asset equal to the projected benefit obligation minus the fair value of plan assets. The amount of a pension asset that can be reported is subject to a ceiling. Under IFRS, the components of periodic pension cost are recognized as follows: Service cost is recognized in P&L, net interest income/expense is recognized in P&L, and re-measurements are recognized in OCI and are not amortized to future P&L. Under US GAAP, the components of periodic pension cost recognized in P&L include current service costs, interest expense on the pension obligation, and expected returns on plan assets (which reduces the cost). Other components of periodic pension cost including past service costs, actuarial gains and losses, and differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets are recognized in OCI and amortized to future P&L. Estimates of the future obligation under defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefits are sensitive to numerous assumptions, including discount rates, assumed annual compensation increases, expected return on plan assets, and assumed health care cost inflation. Employee compensation packages are structured to fulfill varied objectives, including satisfying employees’ needs for liquidity, retaining employees, and providing incentives to employees. Common components of employee compensation packages are salary, bonuses, and share-based compensation. Share based compensation serves to align employees’ interests with those of the shareholders. It includes stocks and stock options. Share based compensation has the advantage of requiring no current-period cash outlays. Share based compensation expense is reported at fair value under IFRS and US GAAP. The valuation technique, or option pricing model, that a company uses is an important choice in determining fair value and is disclosed. Key assumptions and input into option pricing models include such items as exercise price, stock price volatility, estimated life of each award, estimated number of options that will be forfeited, dividend yield, and the risk free rate of interest. Certain assumptions are highly subjective, such as stock price volatility or the expected life of stock options, and can greatly change the estimated fair value and thus compensation expense.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/aggregate-output-prices-economic-growth.pdf,Economics,2021,Level I,"In the field of economics, microeconomics is the study of the economic activity and behavior of individual economic units, such as a household, a company, or a market for a particular good or service, and macroeconomics is the study of the aggregate activities of households, companies, and markets. Macroeconomics focuses on national aggregates, such as total investment , the amount spent by all businesses on plant and equipment; total consumption , the amount spent by all households on goods and services; the rate of change in the general level of prices; and the overall level of interest rates. Macroeconomic analysis examines a nation’s aggregate output and income, its competitive and comparative advantages, the productivity of its labor force, its price level and inflation rate, and the actions of its national government and central bank. The objective of macroeconomic analysis is to address such fundamental questions as: What is an economy’s aggregate output, and how is aggregate income measured? What factors determine the level of aggregate output/income for an economy? What are the levels of aggregate demand and aggregate supply of goods and services within the country? Is the level of output increasing or decreasing, and at what rate? Is the general price level stable, rising, or falling? Is unemployment rising or falling? Are households spending or saving more? Are workers able to produce more output for a given level of inputs? Are businesses investing in and expanding their productive capacity? Are exports (imports) rising or falling? From an investment perspective, investors must be able to evaluate a country’s current economic environment and to forecast its future economic environment in order to identify asset classes and securities that will benefit from economic trends occurring within that country. Macroeconomic variables—such as the level of inflation, unemployment, consumption, government spending, and investment—affect the overall level of activity within a country. They also have different impacts on the growth and profitability of industries within a country, the companies within those industries, and the returns of the securities issued by those companies. This reading is organized as follows: Section 2 describes gross domestic product and related measures of domestic output and income. Section 3 discusses short-run and long-run aggregate demand and supply curves, the causes of shifts and movements along those curves, and factors that affect equilibrium levels of output, prices, and interest rates. Section 4 discusses sources, sustainability, and measures of economic growth. A summary and practice problems complete the reading","The member should be able to: calculate and explain gross domestic product (GDP) using expenditure and income approaches; compare the sum-of-value-added and value-of-final-output methods of calculating GDP; compare nominal and real GDP and calculate and interpret the GDP deflator; compare GDP, national income, personal income, and personal disposable income; explain the fundamental relationship among saving, investment, the fiscal balance, and the trade balance; explain the IS and LM curves and how they combine to generate the aggregate demand curve; explain the aggregate supply curve in the short run and long run; explain causes of movements along and shifts in aggregate demand and supply curves; describe how fluctuations in aggregate demand and aggregate supply cause short-run changes in the economy and the business cycle; distinguish between the following types of macroeconomic equilibria: long-run full employment, short-run recessionary gap, short-run inflationary gap, and short-run stagflation; explain how a short-run macroeconomic equilibrium may occur at a level above or below full employment; analyze the effect of combined changes in aggregate supply and demand on the economy; describe sources, measurement, and sustainability of economic growth; describe the production function approach to analyzing the sources of economic growth; distinguish between input growth and growth of total factor productivity as components of economic growth.","This reading introduces important macroeconomic concepts and principles for macroeconomic forecasting and related investment decision making. Macroeconomics examines the economy as a whole by focusing on a country’s aggregate output of final goods and services, total income, aggregate expenditures, and the general price level. The first step in macroeconomic analysis is to measure the size of an economy. Gross domestic product enables us to assign a monetary value to an economy’s level of output or aggregate expenditures. The interaction of aggregate demand and aggregate supply determines the level of GDP as well as the general price level. The business cycle reflects shifts in aggregate demand and short-run aggregate supply. The long-term sustainable growth rate of the economy depends on growth in the supply and quality of inputs (labor, capital, and natural resources) and advances in technology. From an investment perspective, macroeconomic analysis and forecasting are important because business profits, asset valuations, interest rates, and inflation rates depend on the business cycle in the short to intermediate term and on the drivers of sustainable economic growth in the long term. In addition, it is important to understand fiscal and monetary policies’ economic impact on and implications for inflation, household consumption and saving, capital investment, and exports. GDP is the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given time period. GDP can be valued by looking at either the total amount spent on goods and services produced in the economy or the income generated in producing those goods and services. GDP counts only final purchases of newly produced goods and services during the current time period. Transfer payments and capital gains are excluded from GDP. With the exception of owner-occupied housing and government services, which are estimated at imputed values, GDP includes only goods and services that are valued by being sold in the market. Intermediate goods are excluded from GDP in order to avoid double counting. GDP can be measured either from the value of final output or by summing the value added at each stage of the production and distribution process. The sum of the value added by each stage is equal to the final selling price of the good. Nominal GDP is the value of production using the prices of the current year. Real GDP measures production using the constant prices of a base year. The GDP deflator equals the ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP. Households earn income in exchange for providing—directly or indirectly through ownership of businesses—the factors of production (labor, capital, natural resources including land). From this income, they consume, save, and pay net taxes. Businesses produce most of the economy’s output/income and invest to maintain and expand productive capacity. Companies retain some earnings but pay out most of their revenue as income to the household sector and as taxes to the government. The government sector collects taxes from households and businesses and purchases goods and services, for both consumption and investment, from the private business sector. Foreign trade consists of exports and imports. The difference between the two is net exports. If net exports are positive (negative), then the country spends less (more) than it earns. Net exports are balanced by accumulation of either claims on the rest of the world (net exports > 0) or obligations to the rest of the world (net exports < 0). Capital markets provide a link between saving and investment in the economy. From the expenditure side, GDP includes personal consumption ( C ), gross private domestic investment ( I ), government spending ( G ), and net exports ( X – M ). The major categories of expenditure are often broken down into subcategories. Gross private domestic investment includes both investment in fixed assets (plant and equipment) and the change in inventories. In some countries, government spending on investment is separated from other government spending. National income is the income received by all factors of production used in the generation of final output. It equals GDP minus the capital consumption allowance (depreciation) and a statistical discrepancy. Personal income reflects pre-tax income received by households. It equals national income plus transfers minus undistributed corporate profits, corporate income taxes, and indirect business taxes. Personal disposable income equals personal income minus personal taxes. Private saving must equal investment plus the fiscal and trade deficits. That is, S = I + ( G – T ) + ( X – M ). Consumption spending is a function of disposable income. The marginal propensity to consume represents the fraction of an additional unit of disposable income that is spent. Investment spending depends on the average interest rate and the level of aggregate income. Government purchases and tax policy are often considered to be exogenous variables determined outside the macroeconomic model. Actual taxes collected depend on income and are, therefore, endogenous—that is, determined within the model. The IS curve reflects combinations of GDP and the real interest rate such that aggregate income/output equals planned expenditures. The LM curve reflects combinations of GDP and the interest rate such that demand and supply of real money balances are equal. Combining the IS and LM relationships yields the aggregate demand curve. Aggregate demand and aggregate supply determine the level of real GDP and the price level. The aggregate demand curve is the relationship between real output (GDP) demanded and the price level, holding underlying factors constant. Movements along the aggregate demand curve reflect the impact of price on demand. The aggregate demand curve is downward sloping because a rise in the price level reduces wealth, raises real interest rates, and raises the price of domestically produced goods versus foreign goods. The aggregate demand curve is drawn assuming a constant money supply. The aggregate demand curve will shift if there is a change in a factor, other than price, that affects aggregate demand. These factors include household wealth, consumer and business expectations, capacity utilization, monetary policy, fiscal policy, exchange rates, and foreign GDP. The aggregate supply curve is the relationship between the quantity of real GDP supplied and the price level, keeping all other factors constant. Movements along the supply curve reflect the impact of price on supply. The short-run aggregate supply curve is upward sloping because higher prices result in higher profits and induce businesses to produce more and laborers to work more. In the short run, some prices are sticky, implying that some prices do not adjust to changes in demand. In the long run, all prices are assumed to be flexible. The long-run aggregate supply curve is vertical because input costs adjust to changes in output prices, leaving the optimal level of output unchanged. The position of the curve is determined by the economy’s level of potential GDP. The level of potential output, also called the full employment or natural level of output, is unobservable and difficult to measure precisely. This concept represents an efficient and unconstrained level of production at which companies have enough spare capacity to avoid bottlenecks and there is a balance between the pool of unemployed workers and the pool of job openings. The long-run aggregate supply curve will shift because of changes in labor supply, supply of physical and human capital, and productivity/technology. The short-run supply curve will shift because of changes in potential GDP, nominal wages, input prices, expectations about future prices, business taxes and subsidies, and the exchange rate. The business cycle and short-term fluctuations in GDP are caused by shifts in aggregate demand and aggregate supply. When the level of GDP in the economy is below potential GDP, such a recessionary situation exerts downward pressure on the aggregate price level. When the level of GDP is above potential GDP, such an overheated situation puts upward pressure on the aggregate price level. Stagflation, a combination of high inflation and weak economic growth, is caused by a decline in short-run aggregate supply. The sustainable rate of economic growth is measured by the rate of increase in the economy’s productive capacity or potential GDP. Growth in real GDP measures how rapidly the total economy is expanding. Per capita GDP, defined as real GDP divided by population, reflects the standard of living in a country. Real GDP growth rates and levels of per capita GDP vary widely among countries. The sources of economic growth include the supply of labor, the supply of physical and human capital, raw materials, and technological knowledge. Output can be described in terms of a production function. For example, Y = A F ( L , K ) where L is the quantity of labor, K is the capital stock, and A represents technological knowledge or total factor productivity. The function F (·) is assumed to exhibit constant returns to scale but diminishing marginal productivity for each input individually. Total factor productivity is a scale factor that reflects the portion of output growth that is not accounted for by changes in the capital and labor inputs. TFP is mainly a reflection of technological change. Based on a two-factor production function, Potential GDP growth = Growth in TFP + W L (Growth in labor) + W C (Growth in capital), where W L and W C (= 1 – W L ) are the shares of labor and capital in GDP. Diminishing marginal productivity implies that increasing the supply of some input(s) relative to other inputs will lead to diminishing returns and cannot be the basis for sustainable growth. In particular, long-term sustainable growth cannot rely solely on capital deepening, that is, increasing the stock of capital relative to labor. given the relative scarcity and hence high productivity of capital in developing countries, the growth rate of developing countries should exceed that of developed countries. The labor supply is determined by population growth, the labor force participation rate, and net immigration. The capital stock in a country increases with investment. Correlation between long-run economic growth and the rate of investment is high. In addition to labor, capital, and technology, human capital—essentially, the quality of the labor force—and natural resources are important determinants of output and growth. Technological advances are discoveries that make it possible to produce more and/or higher-quality goods and services with the same resources or inputs. Technology is the main factor affecting economic growth in developed countries. The sustainable rate of growth in an economy is determined by the growth rate of the labor supply plus the growth rate of labor productivity.

https://missingpdf.com/,Equity Investments,2018,Level II,"Discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation views the intrinsic value of a security as the present value of its expected future cash flows. When applied to dividends, the DCF model is the discounted dividend approach or dividend discount model (DDM). This reading extends DCF analysis to value a company and its equity securities by valuing free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE). Whereas dividends are the cash flows actually paid to stockholders, free cash flows are the cash flows available for distribution to shareholders. Unlike dividends, FCFF and FCFE are not readily available data. Analysts need to compute these quantities from available financial information, which requires a clear understanding of free cash flows and the ability to interpret and use the information correctly. Forecasting future free cash flows is also a rich and demanding exercise. The analyst’s understanding of a company’s financial statements, its operations, its financing, and its industry can pay real “dividends” as he or she addresses that task. Many analysts consider free cash flow models to be more useful than DDMs in practice. Free cash flows provide an economically sound basis for valuation. Analysts like to use free cash flow as the return (either FCFF or FCFE) whenever one or more of the following conditions is present: The company does not pay dividends. The company pays dividends but the dividends paid differ significantly from the company’s capacity to pay dividends. Free cash flows align with profitability within a reasonable forecast period with which the analyst is comfortable. The investor takes a “control” perspective. With control comes discretion over the uses of free cash flow. If an investor can take control of the company (or expects another investor to do so), dividends may be changed substantially; for example, they may be set at a level approximating the company’s capacity to pay dividends. Such an investor can also apply free cash flows to uses such as servicing the debt incurred in an acquisition. Common equity can be valued directly by using FCFE or indirectly by first using a FCFF model to estimate the value of the firm and then subtracting the value of noncommon-stock capital (usually debt) from FCFF to arrive at an estimate of the value of equity. The purpose of this reading is to develop the background required to use the FCFF or FCFE approaches to value a company’s equity. Section 2 defines the concepts of free cash flow to the firm and free cash flow to equity and then presents the two valuation models based on discounting of FCFF and FCFE. We also explore the constant-growth models for valuing FCFF and FCFE, which are special cases of the general models, in this section. After reviewing the FCFF and FCFE valuation process in Section 2, we turn in Section 3 to the vital task of calculating and forecasting FCFF and FCFE. Section 4 explains multistage free cash flow valuation models and presents some of the issues associated with their application. Analysts usually value operating assets and nonoperating assets separately and then combine them to find the total value of the firm, an approach described in Section 5.","The candidate should be able to: compare the free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE) approaches to valuation; explain the ownership perspective implicit in the FCFE approach; explain the appropriate adjustments to net income, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), and cash flow from operations (CFO) to calculate FCFF and FCFE; calculate FCFF and FCFE; describe approaches for forecasting FCFF and FCFE; compare the FCFE model and dividend discount models; explain how dividends, share repurchases, share issues, and changes in leverage may affect future FCFF and FCFE; evaluate the use of net income and EBITDA as proxies for cash flow in valuation; explain the single-stage (stable-growth), two-stage, and three-stage FCFF and FCFE models and select and justify the appropriate model given a company’s characteristics; estimate a company’s value using the appropriate free cash flow model(s); explain the use of sensitivity analysis in FCFF and FCFE valuations; describe approaches for calculating the terminal value in a multistage valuation model; evaluate whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued based on a free cash flow valuation model.","Discounted cash flow models are widely used by analysts to value companies. Free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE) are the cash flows available to, respectively, all of the investors in the company and to common stockholders. Analysts like to use free cash flow (either FCFF or FCFE) as the return: if the company is not paying dividends; if the company pays dividends but the dividends paid differ significantly from the company’s capacity to pay dividends; if free cash flows align with profitability within a reasonable forecast period with which the analyst is comfortable; or if the investor takes a control perspective. The FCFF valuation approach estimates the value of the firm as the present value of future FCFF discounted at the weighted average cost of capital: Firm value = ∑ t = 1 ∞ FCFF t ( 1 + WACC ) t The value of equity is the value of the firm minus the value of the firm’s debt: Equity Value = Firm value – Market value of debt Dividing the total value of equity by the number of outstanding shares gives the value per share. The WACC formula is WACC = MV ( Debt ) MV ( Debt ) + MV ( Equity ) r d ( 1 − Tax rate ) + MV(Equity) MV ( Debt ) + MV ( Equity ) r The value of the firm if FCFF is growing at a constant rate is Firm value = FCFF 1 WACC − g = FCFF 0 ( 1 + g ) WACC − g With the FCFE valuation approach, the value of equity can be found by dis - counting FCFE at the required rate of return on equity, r : Equity value = ∑ t = 1 ∞ FCFE t ( 1 + r ) t Dividing the total value of equity by the number of outstanding shares gives the value per share. The value of equity if FCFE is growing at a constant rate is Equity value = FCFE 1 r − g = FCFE 0 ( 1 + g ) r − g FCFF and FCFE are frequently calculated by starting with net income: FCFF = NI + NCC + Int(1 – Tax rate) – FCInv – WCInv FCFE = NI + NCC – FCInv – WCInv + Net borrowing FCFF and FCFE are related to each other as follows: FCFE = FCFF – Int(1 – Tax rate) + Net borrowing FCFF and FCFE can be calculated by starting from cash flow from operations: FCFF = CFO + Int(1 – Tax rate) – FCInv FCFE = CFO – FCInv + Net borrowing FCFF can also be calculated from EBIT or EBITDA: FCFF = EBIT(1 – Tax rate) + Dep – FCInv – WCInv FCFF = EBITDA(1 – Tax rate) + Dep(Tax rate) – FCInv – WCInv FCFE can then be found by using FCFE = FCFF – Int(1 – Tax rate) + Net borrowing. Finding CFO, FCFF, and FCFE may require careful interpretation of corpo - rate financial statements. In some cases, the needed information may not be transparent. Earnings components such as net income, EBIT, EBITDA, and CFO should not be used as cash flow measures to value a firm. These earnings components either double-count or ignore parts of the cash flow stream. FCFF or FCFE valuation expressions can be easily adapted to accommodate complicated capital structures, such as those that include preferred stock. A general expression for the two-stage FCFF valuation model is Firm value = ∑ t = 1 n FCFF t ( 1 + WACC ) t + FCFF n + 1 ( WACC − g ) 1 ( 1 + WACC ) n A general expression for the two-stage FCFE valuation model is Equity value = ∑ t = 1 n FCFE t ( 1 + r ) t + FCFE n + 1 r − g 1 ( 1 + r ) n One common two-stage model assumes a constant growth rate in each stage, and a second common model assumes declining growth in Stage 1 followed by a long-run sustainable growth rate in Stage 2. To forecast FCFF and FCFE, analysts build a variety of models of varying complexity. A common approach is to forecast sales, with profitability, investments, and financing derived from changes in sales. Three-stage models are often considered to be good approximations for cash flow streams that, in reality, fluctuate from year to year. Nonoperating assets, such as excess cash and marketable securities, noncurrent investment securities, and nonperforming assets, are usually segregated from the company’s operating assets. They are valued separately and then added to the value of the company’s operating assets to find total firm value.

Issuers make capital investments to generate value for their stakeholders by returning long-term benefits and future cash flows greater than the associated funding cost of the capital invested. How companies allocate capital between competing priorities and the resulting capital investment portfolio are central to a company’s success and together constitute a fundamental area for analysts to understand. Given that corporate disclosure of capital investments typically is given at a very high level and often lacks specifics, the evaluation of a company’s capital investments is often challenging for analysts. Capital investments describe a company’s future prospects better than its working capital or capital structure, which are often similar for companies, and provide insight into the quality of management’s decisions and how the company is creating value for stakeholders. Although the focus of this coverage is on capital investments, companies also make other investments in increased working capital, information technology (IT), and human resources projects. These investments might not be capitalized and therefore affect near-term operating profit, but they are made for similar long-term benefit as capital investments.","The member should be able to: describe types of capital investments made by companies; describe the capital allocation process and basic principles of capital allocation; demonstrate the use of net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) in allocating capital and describe the advantages and disadvantages of each method; describe common capital allocation pitfalls; describe expected relations among a company’s investments, company value, and share price; and describe types of real options relevant to capital investment.","Capital investments—those investments with a life of one year or longer—are key in determining whether a company is profitable and generating value for its shareholders. Capital allocation is the process companies use to decide their capital investment activity. This reading introduces capital investments, basic principles underlying the capital allocation model, and the use of NPV and IRR decision criteria. Companies invest for two reasons: to maintain their existing businesses and to grow them. Projects undertaken by companies to maintain a business including operating efficiencies are (1) going concern projects and (2) regulatory/compliance projects, while (3) expansion projects and (4) other projects are undertaken by companies to strategically expand or grow their operations. Capital allocation supports the most critical investments for many corporations—their investments in long-term assets. The principles of capital allocation are also relevant and can be applied to other corporate investing and financing decisions and to security analysis and portfolio management. The typical steps companies take in the capital allocation process are (1) idea generation, (2) investment analysis, (3) capital allocation planning, and (4) postaudit and monitoring. Companies should base their capital allocation decisions on the investment project’s incremental after-tax cash flows discounted at the opportunity cost of funds. In addition, companies should ignore financing costs because both the cost of debt and the cost of other capital are captured in the discount rate used in the analysis. The NPV of an investment project is the present value of its after-tax cash flows (or the present value of its after-tax cash inflows minus the present value of its after-tax outflows) or NPV = Σ t=0 n CF t _ (1 + r) t, where the investment outlays are negative cash flows included in CFt, and r is the required rate of return for the investment. Microsoft Excel functions to solve for the NPV for both conventional and unconventional cash flow patterns are NPV or = NPV (rate, values), and XNPV or = XNPV (rate, values, dates), where “rate” is the discount rate, “values” are the cash flows, and “dates” are the dates of each of the cash flows. The IRR is the discount rate that makes the present value of all future cash flows of the project sum to zero. This equation can be solved for the IRR: Σ t=0 n CF t _ (1 + IRR) t = 0. Using Microsoft Excel functions to solve for IRR, the functions are IRR or = IRR (values, guess), and XIRR or =XIRR (values, dates, guess), where “values” are the cash flows, “guess” is an optional user-specified guess that defaults to 10%, and “dates” are the dates of each cash flow. Companies should invest in a project if the NPV > 0 or if the IRR > r. For mutually exclusive investments that are ranked differently by the NPV and IRR, the NPV criterion is the more economically sound approach that companies should use. The fact that projects with positive NPVs theoretically increase the value of the company and the value of its stock could explain the use and popularity of the NPV method by companies. Real options allow companies to make future decisions contingent on future economic information or events that change the value of capital investment decisions the company has made today. These can be classified as (1) timing options; (2) sizing options, which can be abandonment options or growth (expansion) options; (3) flexibility options, which can be price-setting options or production-flexibility options; and (4) fundamental options.

Primary derivative types include a firm commitment in which a predetermined amount is agreed to be exchanged between counterparties at settlement and a contingent claim in which one of the counterparties determines whether and when the trade will settle. The following lessons define and compare the basic features of forward commitments and contingent claims and explain how to calculate their values at maturity.","The member should be able to: define forward contracts, futures contracts, swaps, options (calls and puts), and credit derivatives and compare their basic characteristics; determine the value at expiration and profit from a long or a short position in a call or put option; and contrast forward commitments with contingent claims.","Forwards, futures, and swaps represent firm commitments, or derivative contracts that require counterparties to exchange an underlying in the future based on an agreed-on price. Forwards are a flexible over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instrument, whereas futures are standardized and traded on an exchange with a daily settlement of contract gains and losses. Swap contracts are a firm commitment to exchange a series of cash flows in the future. Interest rate swaps are the most common type and involve the exchange of fixed interest payments for floating interest payments. Option contracts are contingent claims in which one of the counterparties determines whether and when a trade will settle. The option buyer pays a premium to the seller for the right to transact the underlying in the future at an agreed-upon exercise price. Credit default swap (CDS) contracts allow an investor to manage the risk of loss from issuer default separately from a cash bond. Market participants often create similar exposures to an underlying using firm commitments and contingent claims, although these derivative instrument types involve different payoff and profit profiles.

For example, previous lessons demonstrated that forward commitments have a price that prevents market participants from earning riskless profit through arbitrage. It was also shown that long and short forward commitments may be replicated using a combination of long or short cash positions and borrowing or lending at the risk-free rate. Finally, both forward and futures pricing and valuation incorporate the cost of carry, or the benefits and costs of owning an underlying asset over the life of a derivative contract. We now turn our attention to futures contracts. We discuss what distinguishes them from other forward commitments and how they are used by issuers and investors. We expand upon the daily settlement of futures contract gains and losses introduced earlier and explain the differences between forwards and futures. We also address and distinguish the interest rate futures market and its role in interest rate derivative contracts.",The member should be able to: compare the value and price of forward and futures contracts explain why forward and futures prices differ,"Futures are standardized, exchange-traded derivatives (ETDs) with zero initial value and a futures price f 0 (T) established at inception. The futures price, f 0 (T) , equals the spot price compounded at the risk-free rate as in the case of a forward contract. The primary difference between forward and futures valuation is the daily settlement of futures gains and losses via a margin account. Daily settlement resets the futures contract value to zero at the current futures price f t (T) . This process continues until contract maturity and the futures price converge to the spot price, S T . The cumulative realized mark-to-market (MTM) gain or loss on a futures contract is approximately the same as for a comparable forward contract. Daily settlement and margin requirements give rise to different cash flow patterns between futures and forwards, resulting in a pricing difference between the two contract types. The difference depends on both interest rate volatility and the correlation between interest rates and futures prices. The futures price for short-term interest rate futures is given by (100 – yield), where yield is expressed in percentage terms. There is a price difference between interest rate futures and forward rate agreements (FRAs) due to convexity bias. The emergence of derivatives central clearing has introduced futures-like margining requirements for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, such as forwards. This arrangement has reduced the difference in the cash flow impact of ETDs and OTC derivatives and the price difference in futures versus forwards.

https://missingpdf.com/,Equity Investments,2018,Level II,"Among the most familiar and widely used valuation tools are price and enterprise value multiples. Price multiples are ratios of a stock’s market price to some measure of fundamental value per share. Enterprise value multiples , by contrast, relate the total market value of all sources of a company’s capital to a measure of fundamental value for the entire company. The intuition behind price multiples is that investors evaluate the price of a share of stock—judge whether it is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued—by considering what a share buys in terms of per share earnings, net assets, cash flow or some other measure of value (stated on a per share basis). The intuition behind enterprise value multiples is similar; investors evaluate the market value of an entire enterprise relative to the amount of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), sales, or operating cash flow it generates. As valuation indicators (measures or indicators of value), multiples have the appealing qualities of simplicity in use and ease in communication. A multiple summarizes in a single number the relationship between the market value of a company’s stock (or of its total capital) and some fundamental quantity, such as earnings, sales, or book value (owners’ equity based on accounting values). Among the questions we will study in this reading for answers that will help in making correct use of multiples as valuation tools are the following: What accounting issues affect particular price and enterprise value multiples, and how can analysts address them? How do price multiples relate to fundamentals, such as earnings growth rates, and how can analysts use this information when making valuation comparisons among stocks? For which types of valuation problems is a particular price or enterprise value multiple appropriate or inappropriate? What challenges arise in applying price and enterprise value multiples internationally? Multiples may be viewed as valuation indicators relating to individual securities. Another type of valuation indicator used in securities selection is momentum indicators . They typically relate either price or a fundamental (such as earnings) to the time series of its own past values or, in some cases, to its expected value. The logic behind the use of momentum indicators is that such indicators may provide infor-mation on future patterns of returns over some time horizon. Because the purpose of momentum indicators is to identify potentially rewarding investment opportunities, they can be viewed as a class of valuation indicators with a focus that is different from and complementary to the focus of price and enterprise value multiples. This reading is organized as follows. In Section 2, we put the use of price and enterprise value multiples in an economic context and present certain themes common to the use of any price or enterprise value multiple. Section 3 presents price multiples; a subsection is devoted to each multiple. The treatment of each multiple follows a common format: usage considerations, the relationship of the multiple to investors’ expectations about fundamentals, and using the multiple in valuation based on comparables. Section 4 presents enterprise value multiples and is organized similarly to Section 3. Section 5 presents international considerations in using multiples. A treatment of momentum indicators follows in Section 6. Section 7 discusses several practical issues that arise in using valuation indicators. We then summarize the reading, and the reading concludes with practice problems.","The candidate should be able to: distinguish between the method of comparables and the method based on forecasted fundamentals as approaches to using price multiples in valuation, and explain economic rationales for each approach; calculate and interpret a justified price multiple; describe rationales for and possible drawbacks to using alternative price multiples and dividend yield in valuation; calculate and interpret alternative price multiples and dividend yield; calculate and interpret underlying earnings, explain methods of normalizing earnings per share (EPS), and calculate normalized EPS; explain and justify the use of earnings yield (E/P); describe fundamental factors that influence alternative price multiples and dividend yield; calculate and interpret the justified price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), price-to-book ratio (P/B), and price-to-sales ratio (P/S) for a stock, based on forecasted fundamentals; calculate and interpret a predicted P/E, given a cross-sectional regression on fundamentals, and explain limitations to the cross-sectional regression methodology; evaluate a stock by the method of comparables and explain the importance of fundamentals in using the method of comparables; calculate and interpret the P/E-to-growth ratio (PEG) and explain its use in relative valuation; calculate and explain the use of price multiples in determining terminal value in a multistage discounted cash flow (DCF) model; explain alternative definitions of cash flow used in price and enterprise value (EV) multiples and describe limitations of each definition; calculate and interpret EV multiples and evaluate the use of EV/EBITDA; explain sources of differences in cross-border valuation comparisons; describe momentum indicators and their use in valuation; explain the use of the arithmetic mean, the harmonic mean, the weighted harmonic mean, and the median to describe the central tendency of a group of multiples; revaluate whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued based on comparisons of multiples.",3.5 PL Record PL credit Manage your Professional Learning credits Categories Valuation,['Valuation'],Market-Based Valuation: Price and Enterprise Value Multiples (2018) ,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/2018/market-based-valuation-price-and-enterprise

Rather than rely on management’s description of its business model, analysts should develop their own understanding. Many firms have conventional business models that are easily understood and described in simple terms, such as manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer, professional firm, or restaurant chain. However, many business models are complex, specialized, or new. Digital technology, in particular, has enabled significant business model innovation, bringing business models into the spotlight. It has spawned new services and markets and has changed the way most businesses operate. In many cases, technology has enabled the disruption of existing business models, allowing new players to win against large and well-established players who lack the capabilities or agility to respond.","The member should be able to: describe key features and types of business models; describe expected relations between a company’s external environment, business model, and financing needs; and explain and classify types of business and financial risks for a company.","A business model describes how a business is organized to deliver value to its customers: who its customers are, how the business serves them, key assets and suppliers, and the supporting business logic. The firm’s “value proposition” refers to the product or service attributes valued by a firm’s target customer that lead those customers to prefer a firm’s offering over those of its competitors, given relative pricing. Channel strategy may be a key element of a business model, and it addresses how the firm is reaching its customers. Pricing is often a key element of the business model. Pricing approaches are typically value or cost based. In addition to the value proposition, a business model should address the “value chain” as well as “how” the firm is structured to deliver that value. Although many firms have conventional business models that are easily understood and described in simple terms, many business models are complex, specialized, or new. Digital technology has enabled significant business model innovation, often based on network effects. To understand the profitability of a business, the analyst should examine margins, break-even points, and “unit economics.” Businesses have different financing needs and risk profiles, depending on both external and firm-specific factors, which will determine the firm’s ability to raise capital.

Such trends as the growth of emerging market economies, globalization, and the rise of populism impact the range of opportunities and threats that companies, industries, nations, and regional groups face. They can be impacted by changes in regulation, disrupted trade flows, or even conflict. Geopolitics is the study of how geography affects politics and international relations. Within the field of geopolitics, analysts study actors—the individuals, organizations, companies, and national governments that carry out political, economic, and financial activities—and how they interact with one another. These relations matter for investments because they contribute to important drivers of investment performance, including economic growth, business performance, market volatility, and transaction costs. Geopolitical risk is the risk associated with tensions or actions between actors that affect the normal and peaceful course of international relations. Geopolitical risk tends to rise when the geographic and political factors underpinning country relations shift. A shift could arise from a change in policy, a natural disaster, a terrorist act, a theft, or war. Investors study geopolitical risk because it has a tangible impact on investment outcomes. On a macroeconomic level, these risks impact capital markets conditions, including economic growth, interest rates, and market volatility. Changes in capital markets conditions can, in turn, have an important influence on asset allocation decisions, including an investor’s choice of geographic exposure. On a portfolio level, geopolitical risk can influence the appropriateness of an investment security or strategy for an investor’s goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. A higher likelihood of geopolitical risk can raise or lower an asset class’s expected return or impact a sector or company’s operating environment, affecting its attractiveness for an investment strategy. There is no shortage of ways in which geopolitical risk can impact a portfolio, so identifying, assessing, and tracking geopolitical risk can be difficult and time consuming. It is thus important for investors to map those potential risks to tangible investment outcomes. In this reading, we will build a framework by which investors can measure, assess, track, and react to geopolitical risk, with a goal of improving investment outcomes.",The member should be able to: describe geopolitics from a cooperation versus competition perspective describe geopolitics and its relationship with globalization describe tools of geopolitics and their impact on regions and economies describe geopolitical risk and its impact on investments,"Geopolitics is the study of how geography affects politics and international relations. Within the field of geopolitics, analysts study actors—the individuals, organizations, companies, and national governments that carry out political, economic, and financial activities—and how they interact with one another. State actors can be cooperative or non-cooperative. There are many reasons why a country may want to cooperate with its neighbors or with other state actors. These reasons are typically defined by a country’s national interest. National security or national defense involves protecting a country, its citizens, economy, and institutions, from external threats. These threats may be broad in nature—from military attack, to terrorism, crime, cyber-security, and even natural disasters. Geographic factors play an important role in shaping a country’s approach to national security and the extent to which it will choose a cooperative approach. Landlocked countries rely extensively on their neighbors for access to vital resources. Countries highly connected to trade routes or countries acting as a conduit for trade may use their geographic location as a lever of power. Generally, strong institutions contribute to more stable internal and external political forces. Countries with strong institutions, including organizations and structures promoting government accountability, rule of law, and property rights, allow them to act with more authority. Globalization is marked by economic and financial cooperation, including the active trade of goods and services, capital flows, currency exchange, and cultural and information exchange. By contrast, anti-globalization or nationalism is the promotion of a country’s own economic interests to the exclusion or detriment of the interests of other nations. Nationalism is marked by limited economic and financial cooperation. Globalization provides potential gains, such as: increased profits—through increasing sales and/or reducing costs, access to resources—market access and investment opportunities, and intrinsic gains—an improved quality of life. Globalization also has some potential drawbacks, such as: unequal economic and financial gains, interdependence that can lead to supply chain disruption, and possible exploitation of social and environmental resources. In general terms, regions, countries, and industries that are more dependent on cross-border goods and capital flows will have higher levels of cooperation. The interdependent nature of globalization may reduce the likelihood that collaborative countries levy economic, financial, or political attacks on one another. However, interdependence can make cooperative actors more vulnerable to geopolitical risk than those less dependent on cooperation and trade. A geopolitical framework for analysis includes four archetypes of country behavior: autarky, hegemony, multilateralism, and bilateralism. Each archetype has its own costs, benefits, and tradeoffs with respect to geopolitical risk. The tools of geopolitics may be separated into three types: national security tools, economic tools, and financial tools. The most extreme example of a national security tool is that of armed conflict. Espionage is an indirect national security tool. Military alliances are often used either to aid in direct conflict or to deter conflict from arising in the first place. Economic tools are used to reinforce a cooperative or non-cooperative stance via economic means. Among state actors, economic tools can include multilateral trade agreements or the global harmonization of tariff rules. Economic tools can also be non-cooperative in nature. Nationalization is a non-cooperative approach to asserting economic control. Financial tools are the actions used to reinforce a cooperative or non-cooperative stance via financial mechanisms. Examples of cooperative financial tools include the free exchange of currencies across borders and allowing foreign investment. Examples of non-cooperative financial tools include limiting access to local currency markets and restricting foreign investment. Geopolitical risk is the risk associated with tensions or actions between actors (state and non-state) that affect the normal and peaceful course of international relations. Geopolitical risk tends to rise when the geographic and political factors underpinning country relations shift. There are three basic types of geopolitical risk: event risk, exogenous risk, and thematic risk. Event risk evolves around set dates known in advance. Political events, for example, often result in changes to investor expectations related to a country’s cooperative stance. Brexit is an example of event risk. Exogenous risk is a sudden or unanticipated risk that can impact either a country’s cooperative stance, the ability of non-state actors to globalize, or both. Examples include sudden uprisings, invasions, or the aftermath of natural disasters. Thematic risks are known risks that evolve and expand over a period of time. Climate change, cyber threats, and the ongoing threat of terrorism fall into this category. To make an assessment, an investor considers geopolitical risk in terms of the following three areas: likelihood it will occur, velocity (speed) of its impact, and size and nature of that impact. Geopolitical risks seldom develop in linear fashion, making it difficult to monitor and forecast their likelihood, velocity, and size and nature of impact on a portfolio. As a result, many investors deploy an approach that includes scenario building and signposting rather than a single point forecast. Scenario analysis is the process of evaluating portfolio outcomes across potential circumstances or states of the world. Scenarios can take the form of qualitative analysis, quantitative measurement, or both. Investors study geopolitical risk because it has a tangible impact on investment outcomes. On a macroeconomic level, these risks can impact capital markets conditions, such as economic growth, interest rates, and market volatility. Changes in capital markets conditions can have an important influence on asset allocation decisions, including an investor’s choice of geographic exposures. On a portfolio level, geopolitical risk can influence the appropriateness of an investment security or strategy for an investor’s goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.

Derivative markets expand the set of opportunities available to market participants beyond the cash market to create or modify exposure to an underlying. The most common derivative underlying assets include equities, fixed income and interest rates, currencies, commodities, and credit. OTC derivative markets involve the initiation of customized, flexible contracts between derivatives end users and financial intermediaries. ETDs are standardized contracts traded on an organized exchange, which requires collateral on deposit to protect against counterparty default. For derivatives that are centrally cleared, a central counterparty (CCP) assumes the counterparty credit risk of the derivative counterparties and provides clearing and settlement services.

Three years after it was founded, NuvoMedia was sold for USD187 million. Soon after, the two entrepreneurs decided to form a new company, this one focused on making electric cars. They named this company in honor of the inventor Nikola Tesla. Because this was a high-risk, capital-intensive endeavor, they used only some of their newfound wealth and sought other investors with expertise in electric vehicles and fundraising capabilities. Elon Musk, an entrepreneur with a shared vision in the commercialization of electric sports cars, joined the team. In addition to making an initial investment of USD6.3 million in Tesla, Musk also helped raise more money from other venture capitalists. Due to conflicts that were not disclosed, Eberhard and Tarpenning resigned just before Tesla came out with its first vehicle, the Roadster, in 2008. Musk took over as CEO and led Tesla’s initial public offering in 2010, which raised USD226 million. In many ways, Tesla’s story is typical of how businesses begin and succeed. They are often started by founders with significant knowledge or technical expertise but who may lack the skills required to manage a business as it grows larger. Capital is needed to fund growth and is initially raised through private channels. Private investors often get involved in the management of the company, especially if they have a large investment at stake. Eventually, even larger amounts of capital are required, and the company is acquired or taken public.

Unlike a forward commitment with a value of zero to both counterparties at inception, an option buyer pays a premium to the seller for the right to transact the underlying in the future at an agreed-upon price. The contingent nature of options affects their price as well as their value over time. In the first lesson, we explore three features distinct to contingent claims related to an option’s value versus the spot price of the underlying: (1) the exercise, or intrinsic, value; (2) the relationship between an option’s spot price and its exercise price, referred to as “moneyness”; and (3) the time value. We then turn to how the arbitrage and replication concepts introduced earlier for forward commitments differ when applied to contingent claims with an asymmetric payoff profile. Finally, we identify and describe factors that determine the value of an option. These lessons focus on European options, which can be exercised only at expiration.","The member should be able to: explain the exercise value, moneyness, and time value of an option; contrast the use of arbitrage and replication concepts in pricing forward commitments and contingent claims; and identify the factors that determine the value of an option and describe how each factor affects the value of an option.","An option’s value includes its exercise value and its time value. The exercise value is the option’s value if it were immediately exercisable, whereas the time value captures the possibility that the passage of time and the variability of the underlying price will increase the profitability of exercise at maturity. Option moneyness expresses the relationship between the underlying price and the exercise price. A put–call option is “at the money” when the underlying price equals the exercise price. An option is more likely to be exercised if it is “in the money”—with an underlying price above (for a call) or below (for a put) the exercise price—and is less likely to be exercised if it is “out of the money.” Because of their asymmetric payoff profile, options are characterized by no-arbitrage price bounds. The lower bound is a function of the present value of the exercise price and the underlying price, whereas the upper bound is the underlying price for a call and the exercise price for a put. As in the case of forward commitments, the replication of option contracts uses a combination of long (for a call) or short (for a put) positions in an underlying asset and borrowing or lending cash. The replicating transaction for an option is based on a proportion of the underlying, which is closely associated with the moneyness of the option. The underlying price, the exercise price, the time to maturity, the risk-free rate, the volatility of the underlying price, and any income or cost associated with owning the underlying asset are key factors in determining the value of an option. Changes in the volatility of the underlying price and the time to expiration usually will have the same directional effect on put and call option values. Changes to the exercise price, the risk-free rate, and any income or cost associated with owning the underlying asset have the opposite effect on call options versus put options.

We focus on how analysts use industry information and corporate disclosures to forecast a company’s future financial results. An effective financial statement model must be based on a thorough understanding of a company’s business, management, strategy, external environment, and historical results. Thus, an analyst begins with a review of the company and its environment—its industry, key products, strategic position, management, competitors, suppliers, and customers. Using this information, an analyst identifies key revenue and cost drivers and assesses the likely impact of relevant trends, such as economic conditions and technological developments. An analyst’s understanding of the fundamental drivers of the business and assessment of future events provide the basis for forecast model inputs. In other words, financial statement modeling is not merely a quantitative or accounting exercise, it is the quantitative expression of an analyst’s expectations for a company and its competitive environment. We begin our discussion with an overview of developing a revenue forecast. We then describe the general approach to forecasting each of the financial statements and demonstrate the construction of a financial statement model, including forecasted revenue, income statements, balance sheets, and statements of cash flows. Then, we describe five key behavioral biases that influence the modeling process and strategies to mitigate them. We turn to several important topics on the effects of micro- and macroeconomic conditions on financial statement models: the impact of competitive factors on prices and costs, the effects of inflation and deflation, technological developments, and long-term forecasting considerations. The reading concludes with a summary. Most of the examples and exhibits used throughout the reading can be downloaded as a Microsoft Excel workbook. Each worksheet in the workbook is labeled with the corresponding example or exhibit number in the text.","The member should be able to: compare top-down, bottom-up, and hybrid approaches for developing inputs to equity valuation models; compare “growth relative to GDP growth” and “market growth and market share” approaches to forecasting revenue; evaluate whether economies of scale are present in an industry by analyzing operating margins and sales levels; demonstrate methods to forecast cost of goods sold and operating expenses; demonstrate methods to forecast nonoperating items, financing costs, and income taxes; describe approaches to balance sheet modeling; demonstrate the development of a sales-based pro forma company model; explain how behavioral factors affect analyst forecasts and recommend remedial actions for analyst biases; explain how competitive factors affect prices and costs; evaluate the competitive position of a company based on a Porter’s five forces analysis; explain how to forecast industry and company sales and costs when they are subject to price inflation or deflation; evaluate the effects of technological developments on demand, selling prices, costs, and margins; explain considerations in the choice of an explicit forecast horizon; and explain an analyst’s choices in developing projections beyond the short-term forecast horizon.","Industry and company analysis are essential tools of fundamental analysis. The key points include the following: Analysts can use a top-down, bottom-up, or hybrid approach to forecasting income and expenses. Top-down approaches usually begin at the level of the overall economy. Bottom-up approaches begin at the level of the individual company or unit within the company (e.g., business segment). Time-series approaches are considered bottom-up, although time-series analysis can be a tool used in top-down approaches. Hybrid approaches include elements of top-down and bottom-up approaches. In a “growth relative to GDP growth” approach to forecasting revenue, the analyst forecasts the growth rate of nominal GDP and industry and company growth relative to GDP growth. In a “market growth and market share” approach to forecasting revenue, the analyst combines forecasts of growth in particular markets with forecasts of a company’s market share in the individual markets. Operating margins that are positively correlated with sales provide evidence of economies of scale in an industry. Some balance sheet line items, such as retained earnings, flow directly from the income statement, whereas accounts receivable, accounts payable, and inventory are closely linked to income statement projections. A common way to model working capital accounts is to use efficiency ratios. Return on invested capital (ROIC), defined as net operating profit less adjusted taxes divided by the difference between operating assets and operating liabilities, is an after-tax measure of profitability. High and persistent levels of ROIC are often associated with having a competitive advantage. Competitive factors affect a company’s ability to negotiate lower input prices with suppliers and to raise prices for products and services. Porter’s five forces framework can be used as a basis for identifying such factors. Inflation (deflation) affects pricing strategy depending on industry structure, competitive forces, and the nature of consumer demand. When a technological development results in a new product that threatens to cannibalize demand for an existing product, a unit forecast for the new product combined with an expected cannibalization factor can be used to estimate the impact on future demand for the existing product. Factors influencing the choice of the explicit forecast horizon include the projected holding period, an investor’s average portfolio turnover, the cyclicality of an industry, company-specific factors, and employer preferences.

Failures in regression functional form are typically due to omitted variables, inappropriate form of variables, inappropriate variable scaling, and inappropriate data pooling; these may lead to the violations of regression assumptions. Heteroskedasticity occurs when the variance of regression errors differs across observations. Unconditional heteroskedasticity is when the error variance is not correlated with the independent variables, whereas conditional heteroskedasticity exists when the error variance is correlated with the values of the independent variables. Unconditional heteroskedasticity creates no major problems for statistical inference, but conditional heteroskedasticity is problematic because it results in underestimation of the regression coefficients’ standard errors, so t -statistics are inflated and Type I errors are more likely. Conditional heteroskedasticity can be detected using the Breusch–Pagan (BP) test, and the bias it creates in the regression model can be corrected by computing robust standard errors. Serial correlation (or autocorrelation) occurs when regression errors are correlated across observations and may be a serious problem in time-series regressions. Serial correlation can lead to inconsistent coefficient estimates, and it underestimates standard errors, so t-statistics are inflated (as with conditional heteroskedasticity). The Breusch–Godfrey (BG) test is a robust method for detecting serial correlation. The BG test uses residuals from the original regression as the dependent variable run against initial regressors plus lagged residuals, and H 0 is the coefficients of the lagged residuals are zero. The biased estimates of standard errors caused by serial correlation can be corrected using robust standard errors, which also correct for conditional heteroskedasticity. Multicollinearity occurs with high pairwise correlations between independent variables or if three or more independent variables form approximate linear combinations that are highly correlated. Multicollinearity results in inflated standard errors and reduced t -statistics. The variance inflation factor (VIF) is a measure for quantifying multicollinearity. If VIF j is 1 for X j , then there is no correlation between X j and the other regressors. VIF j > 5 warrants further investigation, and VIF j > 10 indicates serious multicollinearity requiring correction. Solutions to multicollinearity include dropping one or more of the regression variables, using a different proxy for one of the variables, or increasing the sample size.

This learning module describes the benefits and risks of using derivatives and compares their use among issuers and investors.,"The member should be able to: describe benefits and risks of derivative instruments, and compare the use of derivatives among issuers and investors.","Derivatives allow market participants to allocate, manage, or trade exposure without exchanging an underlying in the cash market. Derivatives also offer greater operational and market efficiency than cash markets and allow users to create exposures unavailable in cash markets. Derivative instruments can involve risks, such as a high degree of implicit leverage and less transparency in some cases than cash instruments, as well as basis, liquidity, and counterparty credit risks. Excessive risk taking in the past by market participants through the use of derivatives has contributed to market destabilization and systemic risk. Issuers typically use derivative instruments to offset or hedge market-based underlying exposures that affect their assets, liabilities, and earnings. Issuers usually seek hedge accounting treatment for derivatives to minimize income statement and cash flow volatility. Investors use derivatives to modify investment portfolio cash flows, replicate investment strategy returns in cash markets, and create exposures unavailable to cash market participants.

We can think about three major categories of alternative investments based on how they differ from “traditional investments”: private capital real assets hedge funds One of the key features of alternative investments is that investing in them requires special skills and information. Investing in alternative assets can require handling illiquidity, transacting on private markets, operating sophisticated investment strategies, or risk–return profiles that are different from those of traditional long-only investments. Why Investors Consider Alternative Investments Alternative investments offer a variety of advantages: broader diversification through accessing a larger universe of investments or because of their lower correlation with traditional asset classes; opportunities for enhanced returns by improving the portfolio’s risk–return profile; and potentially increased returns through higher yields, particularly compared with traditional investments in low–interest rate periods. The 2019 annual report for the Yale University endowment provides one institutional investor’s reasoning for investing in alternatives: The heavy [75.2%] allocation to nontraditional asset classes stems from the diversifying power they provide to the portfolio as a whole. Alternative assets, by their very nature, tend to be less efficiently priced than traditional marketable securities, providing an opportunity to exploit market inefficiencies through active management. Today’s portfolio has significantly higher expected returns and lower volatility than the 1989 portfolio. This quote neatly illustrates the expected characteristics of alternative investments: diversifying power, higher expected returns, and illiquid and potentially less efficient markets. The quote also highlights the importance of having the willingness and the ability to take a long-term perspective. Endowments, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and even family offices allocate increasing portions of their portfolios to alternative investments seeking to benefit from diversification and return opportunities. Alternative investments are not free of risk, of course, and their returns may be correlated with those of other investments, especially in periods of financial crisis. Over a long historical period, the average correlation of returns from alternative investments with those of traditional investments may be low, but in any particular period, the correlation can differ from the average. During periods of economic crisis, correlations among many assets (both alternative and traditional) can increase dramatically. Alternative investments often have many of the following characteristics: narrow specialization of the investment managers, relatively low correlation of returns with those of traditional investments, and less regulation and less transparency than traditional investments. As a result of these characteristics, alternative investments often exhibit the following: limited reliable historical risk and return data; unique legal and tax considerations; higher fees, often including performance or incentive fees; concentrated portfolios; and restrictions on redemptions (i.e., “lockups” and “gates”). Categories of Alternative Investments Considering the variety of alternative investments, it is not surprising that consensus has not been reached on a definitive list of groups or categories. Considerable debate even surrounds the use of categories versus subcategories. For the purpose of this reading, we classify alternative investments three categories and several subcategories, as follows: Private Capital Private Equity (PE) Private Debt Real Assets Real Estate Infrastructure Natural Resources Commodities Agricultural land and Timberland Hedge Funds","The member should be able to: describe types and categories of alternative investments; describe characteristics of direct investment, co-investment, and fund investment methods for alternative investments; and describe investment and compensation structures commonly used in alternative investments.","The following sections provides an overview of the three main categories and their subcategories. Each category is described in detail later in this reading. Private Capital Private equity. PE funds generally invest in companies, whether startups or established firms, that are not listed on a public exchange, or they invest in public companies with the intent to take them private. The majority of PE activity, by value, involves leveraged buyouts of established profitable and cash-generating companies with solid customer bases, proven products, and high-quality management. Venture capital funds, a specialized form of PE that typically involves investing in or providing financing to startup or early-stage companies with high growth potential, represent a small portion of the PE market by value. Private debt. Private debt largely encompasses debt provided to private entities. Forms of private debt include the following: direct lending (private loans with no intermediary), mezzanine loans (private subordinated debt), venture debt (private loans to startup or early-stage companies that may have little or negative cash flow), and distressed debt (debt extended to companies that are “distressed” because of such issues as bankruptcy or other complications with meeting debt obligations). Real Assets Real estate. Real estate investments are made in buildings or land, either directly or indirectly. They include private commercial real estate equity (e.g., ownership of an office building) and private commercial real estate debt (e.g., directly issued loans or mortgages on commercial property). Securitization has broadened the definition of real estate investing to include public real estate equity (e.g., real estate investment trusts, or REITs) and public real estate debt (e.g., mortgage-backed securities). Infrastructure. Infrastructure assets are capital-intensive, long-lived real assets, such as airports, roads, dams, and schools, that are intended for public use and provide essential services. An increasingly common approach to infrastructure investing is a public–private partnership (PPP) approach, in which governments and private investors each have a stake. Infrastructure investments provide exposure to asset cash flows, but the asset generally returns to public authority ownership. Infrastructure can be thought of as “real estate for the public,” with cash flows from landing rights and road tolls. Natural resources Commodities. Commodity investments may take place in physical commodity products, such as grains, metals, and crude oil, either through owning physical assets, using derivative products, or investing in businesses engaged in the exploration and production of physical commodities. Agricultural land (or farmland). Agricultural land involves the cultivation of livestock or plants, and agricultural land investing covers various strategies, including the purchase of farmland to lease it back to farmers or to receive a stream of income from the growth, harvest, and sale of crops (e.g., corn, cotton, wheat) or livestock (e.g., cattle). Timberland. Investing in timberland generally involves investing capital in natural forests or managed tree plantations to earn a return when the trees are harvested. Timberland involves a longer investment cycle than that of agriculture. Timberland investors often rely on various drivers, such as biological growth, to increase the value of the trees so the wood can be sold at favorable prices in the future. Other. Other “real asset” investments may include tangible assets, such as fine wine, art, antique furniture and automobiles, stamps, coins, and other collectibles, and intangible assets, such as patents and litigation actions. “Digital assets” are an emerging investment opportunity. Some include these assets in the “other” category. Since 2015, however, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has defined digital assets as a “digital commodity” and regulates them accordingly. Hedge Funds Hedge funds. Hedge funds are private investment vehicles that manage portfolios of securities or derivative positions using a variety of strategies. They may involve long and short positions and may be highly leveraged. Some hedge funds try to deliver investment performance that is independent of broader market performance. Although hedge funds may be invested entirely in traditional assets, these vehicles are considered alternative because of their specialized approach.

Although many changes are evolutionary, such as launching new products and expanding capacity, others involve more revolutionary changes to the legal and accounting structure of the issuer. The most well-known among these structural changes is acquisitions, in which one company buys another. Other well-known changes include divestitures and spin-offs, in which an issuer sells or separates a segment of its business. Common features among these changes are that they tend to attract significant press and analyst attention and their announcement is associated with increased securities trading volume. T his reading explains how to evaluate corporate restructurings from the perspective of an independent investment analyst. The discussion begins in Section 2 with an overview of corporate restructurings, including putting these events in the context of the corporate life cycle, and corporate issuers’ motivations for pursuing them. Sections 3 and 4 feature a three-step process for evaluating corporate restructurings as an investment analyst. Sections 5–7 demonstrate the evaluation process with case studies for each major type of corporate restructuring. The reading concludes with a summary and practice problems.","The member should be able to: explain types of corporate restructurings and issuers’ motivations for pursuing them; explain the initial evaluation of a corporate restructuring; demonstrate valuation methods for, and interpret valuations of, companies involved in corporate restructurings; demonstrate how corporate restructurings affect an issuer’s earnings per share (EPS); net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) ratio; and weighted average cost of capital; evaluate corporate investment actions, including equity investments, joint ventures, and acquisitions; evaluate corporate divestment actions, including sales and spin-offs; and evaluate cost and balance sheet restructurings.","Corporate issuers seek to alter their destiny, as described by the corporate life cycle, by taking actions known as restructurings. Restructurings include investment actions that increase the size and scope of an issuer’s business, divestment actions that decrease size or scope, and restructuring actions that do not affect scope but improve performance. Investment actions include equity investments, joint ventures, and acquisitions. Investment actions are often made by issuers seeking growth, synergies, or undervalued targets. Divestment actions include sales and spin-offs and are made by issuers seeking to increase growth or profitability or reduce risk by shedding certain divisions and assets. Restructuring actions, including cost cutting, balance sheet restructurings, and reorganizations, do not change the size or scope of issuers but are aimed at improving returns on capital to historical or peer levels. The evaluation of a corporate restructuring is composed of four phases: initial evaluation, preliminary evaluation, modeling, and updating the investment thesis. The entire evaluation generally is done only for material restructurings. The initial evaluation of a corporate restructuring answers the following questions: What is happening? When is it happening? Is it material? And why is it happening? Materiality is defined by both size and fit. One rule of thumb for size is that large actions are those that are greater than 10% of an issuer’s enterprise value (e.g., for an acquisition, consideration in excess of 10% of the acquirer’s preannouncement enterprise value). Fit refers to the alignment between the action and an analyst’s expectations for the issuer. The three common valuation methods for companies involved in corporate restructurings, during the preliminary valuation phase of the evaluation, are comparable company, comparable transaction, and premium paid analysis. Corporate restructurings must be modeled on the financial statements based on the situational specifics. Estimated financial statements that include the effect of a restructuring are known as pro forma financial statements. The weighted average cost of capital for an issuer is determined by the weights of different capital types and the constituent costs of capital. The costs of capital are influenced by both bottom-up and top-down drivers. Bottom-up drivers include stability, profitability, leverage, and asset specificity. Corporate restructurings affect the cost of capital by affecting these drivers.

The income approach includes direct capitalization and discounted cash flow methods. Both methods focus on net operating income as an input to the value of a property and indirectly or directly factor in expected growth. The cost approach estimates the value of a property based on adjusted replacement cost. This approach is typically used for unusual properties for which market comparables are difficult to obtain. The sales comparison approach estimates the value of a property based on what price comparable properties are selling for in the current market. When debt financing is used to purchase a property, additional ratios and returns calculated and interpreted by debt and equity investors include the loan-to-value ratio, the debt service coverage ratio, and leveraged and unleveraged internal rates of return.

Rather, it adjusts for the degrees of freedom by incorporating the number of independent variables. Adjusted R 2 will increase (decrease) if a variable is added to the model that has a coefficient with an absolute value of its t -statistic greater (less) than 1.0. Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) and Schwarz’s Bayesian information criteria (BIC) are also used to evaluate model fit and select the “best” model among a group with the same dependent variable. AIC is preferred if the purpose is prediction, BIC is preferred if goodness of fit is the goal, and lower values of both measures are better. Hypothesis tests of a single coefficient in a multiple regression, using t-tests, are identical to those in simple regression. The joint F -test is used to jointly test a subset of variables in a multiple regression, where the “restricted” model is based on a narrower set of independent variables nested in the broader “unrestricted” model. The null hypothesis is that the slope coefficients of all independent variables outside the restricted model are zero. The general linear F -test is an extension of the joint F -test, where the null hypothesis is that the slope coefficients on all independent variables in the unrestricted model are equal to zero. Predicting the value of the dependent variable using an estimated multiple regression model is similar to that in simple regression. First, sum, for each independent variable, the estimated slope coefficient multiplied by the assumed value of that variable, and then add the estimated intercept coefficient. In multiple regression, the confidence interval around the forecasted value of the dependent variable reflects both model error and sampling error (from forecasting the independent variables); the larger the sampling error, the larger is the standard error of the forecast of Y and the wider is the confidence interval.

Investors also value low correlation and a more risk-neutral source of alpha. Evaluating an alternative investment can be a subtle, qualitative exercise—one that depends on the initial objectives of the investor—as opposed to a purely quantitative, one-size-fits-all exercise. Much of the nuance revolves around not only the total net return created by an alternative investment but also the path and volatility (drawdown risk) required to create the total return as well as how an alternative investment fits into and benefits a larger portfolio of assets—in other words, its portfolio-level correlation benefit. The attraction to alternative investments is often focused on their expected returns, but investors often neglect to consider the atypical risks they present—risks we can examine on both a standalone and portfolio basis: limited transparency low portfolio liquidity high leverage and use of derivatives high product complexity mark-to-market issues, especially for specialized products limited redemption availability difficulty in manager selection and diversification high fees, which can have a nontrivial impact on performance","The member should be able to: describe issues in performance appraisal of alternative investments, and calculate and interpret returns of alternative investments both before and after fees.","Conducting performance appraisal on alternative investments can be challenging because these investments are often characterized by asymmetric risk–return profiles, limited portfolio transparency, illiquidity, product complexity, and complex fee structures. Traditional risk and return measures (such as mean return, standard deviation of returns, and beta) may provide an inadequate picture of alternative investments’ risk and return characteristics. Moreover, these measures may be unreliable or not representative of specific investments. A variety of ratios can be calculated to review the performance of alternative investments, including the Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, Calmar ratio, and mean adequacy ratio (MAR). The internal rate of return (IRR) and multiple on invested capital (MOIC) calculations are often used to evaluate private equity investments, and the cap rate is often used to evaluate real estate investments. Redemption rules, lockup periods, and timing differences in reporting can bring special challenges to performance appraisal of alternative investments.

Interest rate swaps in which fixed cash flows are exchanged for floating payments are the most common type. Subsequent lessons addressed the pricing and valuation of forward and futures contracts across the term structure, which form the building blocks for swap contracts. In this lesson, we will explore how swap contracts are related to these other forward commitment types. Although financial intermediaries often use forward rate agreements or short-term interest rate futures contracts to manage interest rate exposure, issuers and investors usually prefer swap contracts, because they better match rate-sensitive assets and liabilities with periodic cash flows, such as fixed-coupon bonds, variable-rate loans, or known future commitments. It is important for these market participants not only to be able to match expected future cash flows using swaps but also to ensure that their change in value is consistent with existing or desired underlying exposures. The following lessons compare swap contracts with forward contracts and contrast the value and price of swaps.","The member should be able to: describe how swap contracts are similar to but different from a series of forward contracts, and contrast the value and price of swaps.","A swap contract is an agreement between two counterparties to exchange a series of future cash flows, whereas a forward contract is a single exchange of value at a later date. Interest rate swaps are similar to forwards in that both contracts are firm commitments with symmetric payoff profiles and no cash is exchanged at inception, but they differ in that the fixed swap rate is constant, whereas a series of forward contracts has different forward rates at each maturity. A swap is priced by solving for the par swap rate, a fixed rate that sets the present value of all future expected floating cash flows equal to the present value of all future fixed cash flows. The value of a swap at inception is zero (ignoring transaction and counterparty credit costs). On any settlement date, the value of a swap equals the current settlement value plus the present value of all remaining future swap settlements. A swap contract’s value changes as time passes and interest rates change. For example, a rise in expected forward rates increases the present value of floating payments, causing a mark-to-market (MTM) gain for the fixed-rate payer (floating-rate receiver) and an MTM loss for the fixed-rate receiver (floating-rate payer).

The put–call parity relationship linked put option, call option, underlying asset, and risk-free asset prices. This relationship was extended to forward contracts given the equivalence of an underlying asset position and a long forward contract plus a risk-free bond. Forward commitments can be priced without making assumptions about the underlying asset’s price in the future. However, the pricing of options and other contingent claims requires a model for the evolution of the underlying asset’s future price. The first lesson introduces the widely used binomial model to value European put and call options. A simple one-period version is introduced, which may be extended to multiple periods and used to value more complex contingent claims. In the second lesson, we demonstrate the use of risk-neutral probabilities in derivatives pricing.","The member should be able to: explain how to value a derivative using a one-period binomial model, and describe the concept of risk neutrality in derivatives pricing.","The one-period binomial model values contingent claims, such as options, and assumes the underlying asset will either increase by R u (up gross return) or decrease by R d (down gross return) over a single period that corresponds to the expiration of the derivative contract. The binomial model combines an option with the underlying asset to create a risk-free portfolio in which the proportion of the option to the underlying security is determined by a hedge ratio. The hedged portfolio must earn the prevailing risk-free rate of return; otherwise, riskless arbitrage profit opportunities would be available. Valuing a derivative through risk-free hedging is equivalent to computing the discounted expected payoff of the option using risk-neutral probabilities rather than actual probabilities. Neither the actual (real-world) probabilities of underlying price increases or decreases nor the expected return of the underlying are required to price an option. The one-period binomial model can be extended to multiple periods as well to value more complex contingent claims.

Working capital management is the management of a firm’s short-term assets and liabilities and an important aspect of a firm’s operations. The goal of working capital management is to ensure the company has adequate, ready access to funds necessary for day-to-day operations, while avoiding excess reserves that can be a costly drag on the business’ profitability and returns. Having excess levels of working capital can have a harmful effect on shareholder returns. At the same time, insufficient levels of working capital can harm a company if it cannot meet its short-term obligations, leading to product shortages, sales slowdowns, and, in the extreme, bankruptcy. An analyst should carefully evaluate the working capital position of the firm to make an informed decision about the firm’s ability to meet its short-term needs as it works to implement its long-term plans. To assess whether a firm is operating at an optimal level of working capital, financed at the lowest possible cost, an analyst should begin by asking two fundamental questions: What are the required investments in working capital for the firm? How should those investments be financed? Understanding this provides the analyst with a basis for sound valuation analysis.","The member should be able to: compare methods to finance working capital; explain expected relations between working capital, liquidity, and short-term funding needs; describe sources of primary and secondary liquidity and factors affecting a company’s liquidity position; compare a company’s liquidity position with that of peers; and evaluate short-term funding choices available to a company.","We consider key aspects of short-term financial management: the choices available to fund a company’s working capital needs and effective liquidity management. Both are critical in ensuring a company’s day-to-day operations and ability to remain in business. Key points of coverage included the following: Internal and external sources available to finance working capital needs and considerations in their selection. Working capital approaches, their considerations, and their impact on the funding needs of the company. Primary and secondary sources of liquidity and factors that can enhance a company’s liquidity position. The evaluation of a company’s liquidity position and comparison to peers. The evaluation of short-term financing choices based on their characteristics and effective costs.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V1R5_time_series_analysis.pdf,Quantitative Methods,2024,Level II,"As financial analysts, we often use time-series data to make investment decisions. A time series is a set of observations on a variable’s outcomes in different time periods: the quarterly sales for a particular company during the past five years, for example, or the daily returns on a traded security. In this reading, we explore the two chief uses of time-series models: to explain the past and to predict the future of a time series. We also discuss how to estimate time-series models, and we examine how a model describing a particular time series can change over time. The following two examples illustrate the kinds of questions we might want to ask about time series. Suppose it is the beginning of 2020 and we are managing a US-based investment portfolio that includes Swiss stocks. Because the value of this portfolio would decrease if the Swiss franc depreciates with respect to the dollar, and vice versa, holding all else constant, we are considering whether to hedge the portfolio’s exposure to changes in the value of the franc. To help us in making this decision, we decide to model the time series of the franc/dollar exchange rate. Exhibit 1 shows monthly data on the franc/dollar exchange rate. The data are monthly averages of daily exchange rates. Has the exchange rate been more stable since 1987 than it was in previous years? Has the exchange rate shown a long-term trend? How can we best use past exchange rates to predict future exchange rates? As another example, suppose it is the beginning of 2020. We cover retail stores for a sell-side firm and want to predict retail sales for the coming year. Exhibit 2 shows monthly data on US retail sales. The data are not seasonally adjusted, hence the spikes around the holiday season at the turn of each year. Because the reported sales in the stores’ financial statements are not seasonally adjusted, we model seasonally unadjusted retail sales. How can we model the trend in retail sales? How can we adjust for the extreme seasonality reflected in the peaks and troughs occurring at regular intervals? How can we best use past retail sales to predict future retail sales? Some fundamental questions arise in time-series analysis: How do we model trends? How do we predict the future value of a time series based on its past values? How do we model seasonality? How do we choose among time-series models? And how do we model changes in the variance of time series over time? We address each of these issues in this reading. We first describe typical challenges in applying the linear regression model to time-series data. We present linear and log-linear trend models, which describe, respectively, the value and the natural log of the value of a time series as a linear function of time. We then present autoregressive time-series models—which explain the current value of a time series in terms of one or more lagged values of the series. Such models are among the most commonly used in investments, and the section addresses many related concepts and issues. We then turn our attention to random walks. Because such time series are not covariance stationary, they cannot be modeled using autoregressive models unless they can be transformed into stationary series. We therefore explore appropriate transformations and tests of stationarity. The subsequent sections address moving-average time-series models and discuss the problem of seasonality in time series and how to address it. We also cover autoregressive moving-average models, a more complex alternative to autoregressive models. The last two topics are modeling changing variance of the error term in a time series and the consequences of regression of one time series on another when one or both time series may not be covariance stationary.","The member should be able to: calculate and evaluate the predicted trend value for a time series, modeled as either a linear trend or a log-linear trend, given the estimated trend coefficients; describe factors that determine whether a linear or a log-linear trend should be used with a particular time series and evaluate limitations of trend models; explain the requirement for a time series to be covariance stationary and describe the significance of a series that is not stationary; describe the structure of an autoregressive (AR) model of order p and calculate one- and two-period-ahead forecasts given the estimated coefficients; explain how autocorrelations of the residuals can be used to test whether the autoregressive model fits the time series; explain mean reversion and calculate a mean-reverting level; contrast in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts and compare the forecasting accuracy of different time-series models based on the root mean squared error criterion; explain the instability of coefficients of time-series models; describe characteristics of random walk processes and contrast them to covariance stationary processes; describe implications of unit roots for time-series analysis, explain when unit roots are likely to occur and how to test for them, and demonstrate how a time series with a unit root can be transformed so it can be analyzed with an AR model; describe the steps of the unit root test for nonstationarity and explain the relation of the test to autoregressive time-series models; explain how to test and correct for seasonality in a time-series model and calculate and interpret a forecasted value using an AR model with a seasonal lag; explain autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) and describe how ARCH models can be applied to predict the variance of a time series; explain how time-series variables should be analyzed for nonstationarity and/or cointegration before use in a linear regression; and determine an appropriate time-series model to analyze a given investment problem and justify that choice.","The predicted trend value of a time series in period t is b ‸ 0 + b ‸ 1 t in a linear trend model; the predicted trend value of a time series in a log-linear trend model is e b ‸ 0 + b ‸ 1 t . Time series that tend to grow by a constant amount from period to period should be modeled by linear trend models, whereas time series that tend to grow at a constant rate should be modeled by log-linear trend models. Trend models often do not completely capture the behavior of a time series, as indicated by serial correlation of the error term. If the Durbin–Watson statistic from a trend model differs significantly from 2, indicating serial correlation, we need to build a different kind of model. An autoregressive model of order p, denoted AR( p ), uses p lags of a time series to predict its current value: x t = b 0 + b 1 x t −1 + b 2 x t −2 + . . . + b p x t – p + ε t . A time series is covariance stationary if the following three conditions are satisfied: First, the expected value of the time series must be constant and finite in all periods. Second, the variance of the time series must be constant and finite in all periods. Third, the covariance of the time series with itself for a fixed number of periods in the past or future must be constant and finite in all periods. Inspection of a nonstationary time-series plot may reveal an upward or downward trend (nonconstant mean) and/or nonconstant variance. The use of linear regression to estimate an autoregressive time-series model is not valid unless the time series is covariance stationary. For a specific autoregressive model to be a good fit to the data, the autocorrelations of the error term should be 0 at all lags. A time series is mean reverting if it tends to fall when its level is above its long-run mean and rise when its level is below its long-run mean. If a time series is covariance stationary, then it will be mean reverting. The one-period-ahead forecast of a variable x t from an AR(1) model made in period t for period t + 1 is x ‸ t + 1 = b ‸ 0 + b ‸ 1 x t . This forecast can be used to create the two-period-ahead forecast from the model made in period t , x ‸ t + 2 = b ‸ 0 + b ‸ 1 x t + 1 . Similar results hold for AR( p ) models. In-sample forecasts are the in-sample predicted values from the estimated time-series model. Out-of-sample forecasts are the forecasts made from the estimated time-series model for a time period different from the one for which the model was estimated. Out-of-sample forecasts are usually more valuable in evaluating the forecasting performance of a time-series model than are in-sample forecasts. The root mean squared error (RMSE), defined as the square root of the average squared forecast error, is a criterion for comparing the forecast accuracy of different time-series models; a smaller RMSE implies greater forecast accuracy. Just as in regression models, the coefficients in time-series models are often unstable across different sample periods. In selecting a sample period for estimating a time-series model, we should seek to assure ourselves that the time series was stationary in the sample period. A random walk is a time series in which the value of the series in one period is the value of the series in the previous period plus an unpredictable random error. If the time series is a random walk, it is not covariance stationary. A random walk with drift is a random walk with a nonzero intercept term. All random walks have unit roots. If a time series has a unit root, then it will not be covariance stationary. If a time series has a unit root, we can sometimes transform the time series into one that is covariance stationary by first-differencing the time series; we may then be able to estimate an autoregressive model for the first-differenced series. An n -period moving average of the current and past ( n − 1) values of a time series, x t , is calculated as [ x t + x t −1 + . . . + x t −( n −1) ]/ n . A moving-average model of order q , denoted MA( q ), uses q lags of a random error term to predict its current value. The order q of a moving-average model can be determined using the fact that if a time series is a moving-average time series of order q, its first q autocorrelations are nonzero while autocorrelations beyond the first q are zero. The autocorrelations of most autoregressive time series start large and decline gradually, whereas the autocorrelations of an MA( q ) time series suddenly drop to 0 after the first q autocorrelations. This helps in distinguishing between autoregressive and moving-average time series. If the error term of a time-series model shows significant serial correlation at seasonal lags, the time series has significant seasonality. This seasonality can often be modeled by including a seasonal lag in the model, such as adding a term lagged four quarters to an AR(1) model on quarterly observations. The forecast made in time t for time t + 1 using a quarterly AR(1) model with a seasonal lag would be x t + 1 = b ‸ 0 + b ‸ 1 x t + b ‸ 2 x t − 3 . ARMA models have several limitations: The parameters in ARMA models can be very unstable; determining the AR and MA order of the model can be difficult; and even with their additional complexity, ARMA models may not forecast well. The variance of the error in a time-series model sometimes depends on the variance of previous errors, representing autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH). Analysts can test for first-order ARCH in a time-series model by regressing the squared residual on the squared residual from the previous period. If the coefficient on the squared residual is statistically significant, the time-series model has ARCH(1) errors. If a time-series model has ARCH(1) errors, then the variance of the errors in period t + 1 can be predicted in period t using the formula σ ‸ t + 1 2 = a ‸ 0 + a ‸ 1 ε ‸ t 2 . If linear regression is used to model the relationship between two time series, a test should be performed to determine whether either time series has a unit root: If neither of the time series has a unit root, then we can safely use linear regression. If one of the two time series has a unit root, then we should not use linear regression. If both time series have a unit root and the time series are cointegrated, we may safely use linear regression; however, if they are not cointegrated, we should not use linear regression. The (Engle–Granger) Dickey–Fuller test can be used to determine whether time series are cointegrated.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2022/pdf/introduction-alternative-investments.pdf,Alternative Investments,2023,Level I,"In this section, we explain what alternative investments are and why assets under management in alternative investments have grown in recent decades. We also explain how alternative investments differ from traditional investments, and we examine their perceived investment merit. We conclude this section with a brief overview of the various categories of alternative investments; these categories will be explored further in later sections. “Alternative investments” is a label for a disparate group of investments that are distinguished from long-only, publicly traded investments in stocks, bonds, and cash (often referred to as traditional investments). The terms “traditional” and “alternative” should not imply that alternatives are necessarily uncommon or that they are relatively recent additions to the investment universe. Alternative investments include such assets as real estate and commodities, which are arguably two of the oldest types of investments. Alternative investments also include non-traditional approaches to investing within special vehicles, such as private equity funds and hedge funds. These funds may give the manager flexibility to use derivatives and leverage, to make investments in illiquid assets, and to take short positions. The assets in which these vehicles invest can include traditional assets (stocks, bonds, and cash) as well as less traditional assets. Management of alternative investments is typically active. Alternative investments often have many of the following characteristics: Narrow specialization of the investment managers Relatively low correlation of returns with those of traditional investments Less regulation and less transparency than traditional investments Limited historical risk and return data Unique legal and tax considerations Higher fees, often including performance or incentive fees Concentrated portfolios Restrictions on redemptions (i.e., “lockups” and “gates”)","The member should be able to: describe types and categories of alternative investments; describe characteristics of direct investment, co-investment, and fund investment methods for alternative investments; describe investment and compensation structures commonly used in alternative investments; explain investment characteristics of hedge funds; explain investment characteristics of private capital; explain investment characteristics of natural resources; explain investment characteristics of real estate; explain investment characteristics of infrastructure; describe issues in performance appraisal of alternative investments; calculate and interpret returns of alternative investments on both before-fee and after-fee bases.","This reading provides a comprehensive introduction to alternative investments. Some key points of the reading are as follows: Alternative investments are supplemental strategies to traditional long-only positions in stocks, bonds, and cash. Alternative investments include investments in five main categories: hedge funds, private capital, natural resources, real estate, and infrastructure. Alternative investment strategies are typically active, return-seeking strategies that also often have risk characteristics different from those of traditional long-only investments. Characteristics common to many alternative investments, when compared with traditional investments, include the following: lower liquidity, less regulation, lower transparency, higher fees, and limited and potentially problematic historical risk and return data. Alternative investments often have complex legal and tax considerations and may be highly leveraged. Alternative investments are attractive to investors because of the potential for portfolio diversification resulting in a higher risk-adjusted return for the portfolio. Investors can access alternative invests in three ways: Fund investment (such as a in a PE fund) Direct investment into a company or project (such as infrastructure or real estate) Co-investment into a portfolio company of a fund Investors conduct due diligence prior to investing in alternative investments. The due diligence approach depends on the investment method (direct, co-investing, or fund investing). Operational, financial, counterparty, and liquidity risks may be key considerations for those investing in alternative investments. These risks can be analyzed during the due diligence process. It is critical to perform fund due diligence to assess whether (a) the manager can effectively pursue the proposed investment strategy; (b) the appropriate organizational structure and policies for managing investments, operations, risk, and compliance are in place; and (c) the fund terms appear reasonable. Many alternative investments, such as hedge and private equity funds, use a partnership structure with a general partner that manages the business and limited partners (investors) who own fractional interests in the partnership. The general partner typically receives a management fee based on assets under management or committed capital (the former is common to hedge funds, and the latter is common to private equity funds) and an incentive fee based on realized profits. Hurdle rates, high-water marks, lockup and notice periods, and clawback provisions are often specified in the LPA. The fee structure affects the returns to investors (limited partners), with a waterfall representing the distribution method under which allocations are made to LPs and GPs. Waterfalls can be on a whole-of-fund basis (European) or deal-by-deal basis (American). Hedge funds are typically classified by strategy. One such classification includes four broad categories of strategies: equity hedge (e.g., market neutral), event driven (e.g., merger arbitrage), relative value (e.g., convertible bond arbitrage), macro and CTA strategies (e.g., commodity trading advisers). Funds-of-hedge-funds are funds that create a diversified portfolio of hedge funds. These vehicles are attractive to smaller investors that don’t have the resources to select individual hedge funds and build a portfolio of them. Private Capital is a broad term for funding provided to companies that is sourced from neither the public equity nor debt markets. Capital that is provided in the form of equity investments is called private equity, whereas capital that is provided as a loan or other form of debt is called private debt. Private equity refers to investment in privately owned companies or in public companies with the intent to take them private. Key private equity investment strategies include leveraged buyouts (e.g., MBOs and MBIs) and venture capital. Primary exit strategies include trade sale, IPO, and recapitalization. Private debt refers to various forms of debt provided by investors to private entities. Key private debt strategies include direct lending, mezzanine debt, and venture debt. Private debt also includes specialized strategies, such as CLOs, unitranche debt, real estate debt, and infrastructure debt. Natural resources include commodities (hard and soft), agricultural land (farmland), and timberland. Commodity investments may involve investing in actual physical commodities or in producers of commodities, but more typically, these investments are made using commodity derivatives (futures or swaps). One can also invest in commodities via a CTA (see hedge funds). Returns to commodity investing are based on changes in price and do not include an income stream, such as dividends, interest, or rent (apart from income earned on the collateral). However, timberland offers an income stream based on the sale of trees, wood, and other products. Timberland can be thought of as both a factory and a warehouse. Plus, timberland is a sustainable investment that mitigates climate-related risks. Farmland, like timberland, has an income component related to harvest quantities and agricultural commodity prices. However, farmland doesn’t have the production flexibility of timberland, because farm products must be harvested when ripe. Real estate includes two major sectors: residential and commercial. Residential real estate is the largest sector, making up some 75% of the market globally. Commercial real estate primarily includes office buildings, shopping centers, and warehouses. Real estate property has some unique features compared with other asset classes, including heterogeneity (no two properties are identical) and fixed location. Real estate investments can be direct or indirect, in the public market (e.g., REITs) or private transactions, and in equity or debt. The assets underlying infrastructure investments are real, capital intensive, and long lived. These assets are intended for public use, and they provide essential services. Examples include airports, health care facilities, and power plants. Funding is often done on a public–private partnership basis. Social infrastructure assets are directed toward human activities and include such assets as educational, health care, social housing, and correctional facilities, with the focus on providing, operating, and maintaining the asset infrastructure. Infrastructure investments may also be categorized by the underlying asset’s stage of development. Investing in infrastructure assets that are to be constructed is generally referred to as greenfield investment. Investing in existing infrastructure assets may be referred to as brownfield investment. Conducting performance appraisal on alternative investments can be challenging because these investments are often characterized by asymmetric risk–return profiles, limited portfolio transparency, illiquidity, product complexity, and complex fee structures. Traditional risk and return measures (such as mean return, standard deviation of returns, and beta) may provide an inadequate picture of alternative investments’ risk and return characteristics. Moreover, these measures may be unreliable or not representative of specific investments. A variety of ratios can be calculated in order to review the performance of alternative investments, including the Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, Treynor ratio, Calmar ratio, and MAR ratio. In addition, batting average and slugging percentage can also be used. The IRR calculation is often used to evaluate private equity investments, and the cap rate is often used to evaluate real estate investments. Redemption rules and lockup periods can bring special challenges to performance appraisal of alternative investments. When comparing the performance of alternative investments versus an index, the analyst must be aware that indexes for alternative investments may be subject to a variety of biases, including survivorship and backfill biases. Analysts need to be aware of any custom fee arrangements in place that will affect the calculation of fees and performance. These can include such arrangements as fee discounts based on custom liquidity terms or significant asset size; special share classes, such as “founders’ shares”; and a departure from the typical management fee + performance fee structure in favor of “either/or” fees.

Our coverage will go over important concepts, tools, and applications of credit analysis. We first look at modeling credit risk. The inputs to credit risk modeling are the expected exposure to default loss, the loss given default, and the probability of default. We explain these terms and use a numerical example to illustrate the calculation of the credit valuation adjustment for a corporate bond and its credit spread over a government bond yield taken as a proxy for a default-risk-free rate (or default-free rate). We then discuss credit scoring and credit ratings. Credit scoring is a measure of credit risk used in retail loan markets, and ratings are used in the wholesale bond market. We explain two types of credit analysis models used in practice—structural models and reduced-form models. Both models are highly mathematical and beyond the scope of our coverage. Therefore, we provide only an overview to highlight the key ideas and the similarities and differences between them. We then use the arbitrage-free framework and a binomial interest rate tree to value risky fixed-rate and floating-rate bonds for different assumptions about interest rate volatility. We also build on the credit risk model to interpret changes in credit spreads that arise from changes in the assumed probability of default, the recovery rate, or the exposure to default loss. We also explain the term structure of credit spreads and finally compare the credit analysis required for securitized debt with the credit analysis of corporate bonds.","The member should be able to: explain expected exposure, the loss given default, the probability of default, and the credit valuation adjustment; explain credit scores and credit ratings; calculate the expected return on a bond given transition in its credit rating; explain structural and reduced-form models of corporate credit risk, including assumptions, strengths, and weaknesses; calculate the value of a bond and its credit spread, given assumptions about the credit risk parameters; interpret changes in a credit spread; explain the determinants of the term structure of credit spreads and interpret a term structure of credit spreads; compare the credit analysis required for securitized debt to the credit analysis of corporate debt.","This reading has covered several important topics in credit analysis. Among the points made are the following: Three factors important to modeling credit risk are the expected exposure to default, the recovery rate, and the loss given default. These factors permit the calculation of a credit valuation adjustment that is subtracted from the (hypothetical) value of the bond, if it were default risk free, to get the bond’s fair value given its credit risk. The credit valuation adjustment is calculated as the sum of the present values of the expected loss for each period in the remaining life of the bond. Expected values are computed using risk-neutral probabilities, and discounting is done at the risk-free rates for the relevant maturities. The CVA captures investors’ compensation for bearing default risk. The compensation can also be expressed in terms of a credit spread. Credit scores and credit ratings are third-party evaluations of creditworthiness used in distinct markets. Analysts may use credit ratings and a transition matrix of probabilities to adjust a bond’s yield-to-maturity to reflect the probabilities of credit migration. Credit spread migration typically reduces expected return. Credit analysis models fall into two broad categories: structural models and reduced-form models. Structural models are based on an option perspective of the positions of the stakeholders of the company. Bondholders are viewed as owning the assets of the company; shareholders have call options on those assets. Reduced-form models seek to predict when a default may occur, but they do not explain the why as do structural models. Reduced-form models, unlike structural models, are based only on observable variables. When interest rates are assumed to be volatile, the credit risk of a bond can be estimated in an arbitrage-free valuation framework. The discount margin for floating-rate notes is similar to the credit spread for fixed-coupon bonds. The discount margin can also be calculated using an arbitrage-free valuation framework. Arbitrage-free valuation can be applied to judge the sensitivity of the credit spread to changes in credit risk parameters. The term structure of credit spreads depends on macro and micro factors. As it concerns macro factors, the credit spread curve tends to become steeper and widen in conditions of weak economic activity. Market supply and demand dynamics are important. The most frequently traded securities tend to determine the shape of this curve. Issuer- or industry-specific factors, such as the chance of a future leverage-decreasing event, can cause the credit spread curve to flatten or invert. When a bond is very likely to default, it often trades close to its recovery value at various maturities; moreover, the credit spread curve is less informative about the relationship between credit risk and maturity. For securitized debt, the characteristics of the asset portfolio themselves suggest the best approach for a credit analyst to take when deciding among investments. Important considerations include the relative concentration of assets and their similarity or heterogeneity as it concerns credit risk.

We explore basic definitions of such instruments, explain the main concepts, cover elements of valuation and pricing, and discuss applications.","The member should be able to: describe credit default swaps (CDS), single-name and index CDS, and the parameters that define a given CDS product; describe credit events and settlement protocols with respect to CDS; explain the principles underlying and factors that influence the market’s pricing of CDS; describe the use of CDS to manage credit exposures and to express views regarding changes in the shape and/or level of the credit curve; describe the use of CDS to take advantage of valuation disparities among separate markets, such as bonds, loans, equities, and equity-linked instruments.","A credit default swap (CDS) is a contract between two parties in which one party purchases protection from another party against losses from the default of a borrower for a defined period of time. A CDS is written on the debt of a third party, called the reference entity, whose relevant debt is called the reference obligation, typically a senior unsecured bond. A CDS written on a particular reference obligation normally provides coverage for all obligations of the reference entity that have equal or higher seniority. The two parties to the CDS are the credit protection buyer, who is said to be short the reference entity’s credit, and the credit protection seller, who is said to be long the reference entity’s credit. The CDS pays off upon occurrence of a credit event, which includes bankruptcy, failure to pay, and, in some countries, involuntary restructuring. Settlement of a CDS can occur through a cash payment from the credit protection seller to the credit protection buyer as determined by the cheapest-to-deliver obligation of the reference entity or by physical delivery of the reference obligation from the protection buyer to the protection seller in exchange for the CDS notional. A cash settlement payoff is determined by an auction of the reference entity’s debt, which gives the market’s assessment of the likely recovery rate. The credit protection buyer must accept the outcome of the auction even though the ultimate recovery rate could differ. CDS can be constructed on a single entity or as indexes containing multiple entities. Bespoke CDS or baskets of CDS are also common. The fixed payments made from CDS buyer to CDS seller are customarily set at a fixed annual rate of 1% for investment-grade debt or 5% for high-yield debt. Valuation of a CDS is determined by estimating the present value of the payment leg, which is the series of payments made from the protection buyer to the protection seller, and the present value of the protection leg, which is the payment from the protection seller to the protection buyer in event of default. If the present value of the payment leg is greater than the present value of the protection leg, the protection buyer pays an upfront premium to the seller. If the present value of the protection leg is greater than the present value of the payment leg, the seller pays an upfront premium to the buyer. An important determinant of the value of the expected payments is the hazard rate, the probability of default given that default has not already occurred. CDS prices are often quoted in terms of credit spreads, the implied number of basis points that the credit protection seller receives from the credit protection buyer to justify providing the protection. Credit spreads are often expressed in terms of a credit curve, which expresses the relationship between the credit spreads on bonds of different maturities for the same borrower. CDS change in value over their lives as the credit quality of the reference entity changes, which leads to gains and losses for the counterparties, even though default may not have occurred or may never occur. CDS spreads approach zero as the CDS approaches maturity. Either party can monetize an accumulated gain or loss by entering into an offsetting position that matches the terms of the original CDS. CDS are used to increase or decrease credit exposures or to capitalize on different assessments of the cost of credit among different instruments tied to the reference entity, such as debt, equity, and derivatives of debt and equity.

Contingent claims include options, the valuation of which is the objective of this reading. Because many investments contain embedded options, understanding this material is vital for investment management. Our primary purpose is to understand how the values of options are determined. Option values, as with the values of all financial instruments, are typically obtained using valuation models. Any financial valuation model takes certain inputs and turns them into an output that tells us the fair value or price. Option valuation models, like their counterparts in the forward, futures, and swaps markets, are based on the principle of no arbitrage, meaning that the appropriate price of an option is the one that makes it impossible for any party to earn an arbitrage profit at the expense of any other party. The price that precludes arbitrage profits is the value of the option. Using that concept, we then proceed to introduce option valuation models using two approaches. The first approach is the binomial model, which is based on discrete time, and the second is the Black–Scholes–Merton (BSM) model, which is based on continuous time. The reading is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the principles of the no-arbitrage approach to pricing and valuation of options. In Section 3, the binomial option valuation model is explored, and in Section 4, the BSM model is covered. In Section 5, the Black model, being a variation of the BSM model, is applied to futures options, interest rate options, and swaptions. Finally, in Section 6, the Greeks are reviewed along with implied volatility. Section 7 provides a summary.",The member should be able to: describe and interpret the binomial option valuation model and its component terms; calculate the no-arbitrage values of European and American options using a two-period binomial model; identify an arbitrage opportunity involving options and describe the related arbitrage; calculate and interpret the value of an interest rate option using a two-period binomial model; describe how the value of a European option can be analyzed as the present value of the option’s expected payoff at expiration; identify assumptions of the Black–Scholes–Merton option valuation model; interpret the components of the Black–Scholes–Merton model as applied to call options in terms of a leveraged position in the underlying; describe how the Black–Scholes–Merton model is used to value European options on equities and currencies; describe how the Black model is used to value European options on futures; describe how the Black model is used to value European interest rate options and European swaptions; interpret each of the option Greeks; describe how a delta hedge is executed; describe the role of gamma risk in options trading; define implied volatility and explain how it is used in options trading.,"This reading on the valuation of contingent claims provides a foundation for understanding how a variety of different options are valued. Key points include the following: The arbitrageur would rather have more money than less and abides by two fundamental rules: Do not use your own money and do not take any price risk. The no-arbitrage approach is used for option valuation and is built on the key concept of the law of one price, which says that if two investments have the same future cash flows regardless of what happens in the future, then these two investments should have the same current price. Throughout this reading, the following key assumptions are made: Replicating instruments are identifiable and investable. Market frictions are nil. Short selling is allowed with full use of proceeds. The underlying instrument price follows a known distribution. Borrowing and lending is available at a known risk-free rate. The two-period binomial model can be viewed as three one-period binomial models, one positioned at Time 0 and two positioned at Time 1. In general, European-style options can be valued based on the expectations approach in which the option value is determined as the present value of the expected future option payouts, where the discount rate is the risk-free rate and the expectation is taken based on the risk-neutral probability measure. Both American-style options and European-style options can be valued based on the no-arbitrage approach, which provides clear interpretations of the component terms; the option value is determined by working backward through the binomial tree to arrive at the correct current value. For American-style options, early exercise influences the option values and hedge ratios as one works backward through the binomial tree. Interest rate option valuation requires the specification of an entire term structure of interest rates, so valuation is often estimated via a binomial tree. A key assumption of the Black–Scholes–Merton option valuation model is that the return of the underlying instrument follows geometric Brownian motion, implying a lognormal distribution of the return. The BSM model can be interpreted as a dynamically managed portfolio of the underlying instrument and zero-coupon bonds. BSM model interpretations related to N(d 1 ) are that it is the basis for the number of units of underlying instrument to replicate an option, that it is the primary determinant of delta, and that it answers the question of how much the option value will change for a small change in the underlying. BSM model interpretations related to N(d 2 ) are that it is the basis for the number of zero-coupon bonds to acquire to replicate an option and that it is the basis for estimating the risk-neutral probability of an option expiring in the money. The Black futures option model assumes the underlying is a futures or a forward contract. Interest rate options can be valued based on a modified Black futures option model in which the underlying is a forward rate agreement (FRA), there is an accrual period adjustment as well as an underlying notional amount, and that care must be given to day-count conventions. An interest rate cap is a portfolio of interest rate call options termed caplets, each with the same exercise rate and with sequential maturities. An interest rate floor is a portfolio of interest rate put options termed floorlets, each with the same exercise rate and with sequential maturities. A swaption is an option on a swap. A payer swaption is an option on a swap to pay fixed and receive floating. A receiver swaption is an option on a swap to receive fixed and pay floating. Long a callable fixed-rate bond can be viewed as long a straight fixed-rate bond and short a receiver swaption. Delta is a static risk measure defined as the change in a given portfolio for a given small change in the value of the underlying instrument, holding everything else constant. Delta hedging refers to managing the portfolio delta by entering additional positions into the portfolio. A delta neutral portfolio is one in which the portfolio delta is set and maintained at zero. A change in the option price can be estimated with a delta approximation. Because delta is used to make a linear approximation of the non-linear relationship that exists between the option price and the underlying price, there is an error that can be estimated by gamma. Gamma is a static risk measure defined as the change in a given portfolio delta for a given small change in the value of the underlying instrument, holding everything else constant. Gamma captures the non-linearity risk or the risk—via exposure to the underlying—that remains once the portfolio is delta neutral. A gamma neutral portfolio is one in which the portfolio gamma is maintained at zero. The change in the option price can be better estimated by a delta-plus-gamma approximation compared with just a delta approximation. Theta is a static risk measure defined as the change in the value of an option given a small change in calendar time, holding everything else constant. Vega is a static risk measure defined as the change in a given portfolio for a given small change in volatility, holding everything else constant. Rho is a static risk measure defined as the change in a given portfolio for a given small change in the risk-free interest rate, holding everything else constant. Although historical volatility can be estimated, there is no objective measure of future volatility. Implied volatility is the BSM model volatility that yields the market option price. Implied volatility is a measure of future volatility, whereas historical volatility is a measure of past volatility. Option prices reflect the beliefs of option market participant about the future volatility of the underlying. The volatility smile is a two dimensional plot of the implied volatility with respect to the exercise price. The volatility surface is a three dimensional plot of the implied volatility with respect to both expiration time and exercise prices. If the BSM model assumptions were true, then one would expect to find the volatility surface flat, but in practice, the volatility surface is not flat.

Given that investment in commodities is conducted primarily through futures markets, the concepts and theories behind commodity futures is a primary focus of the reading. In particular, the relationship between spot and futures prices, as well as the underlying components of futures returns, are key analytical considerations. What do we mean when we talk about investing in commodities? A basic economic definition is that a commodity is a physical good attributable to a natural resource that is tradable and supplied without substantial differentiation by the general public. Commodities trade in physical (spot) markets and in futures and forward markets. Spot markets involve the physical transfer of goods between buyers and sellers; prices in these markets reflect current (or very near term) supply and demand conditions. Global commodity futures markets constitute financial exchanges of standardized futures contracts in which a price is established in the market today for the sale of some defined quantity and quality of a commodity at a future date of delivery; completion of the contract may permit cash settlement or require physical delivery. Commodity futures exchanges allow for risk transfer and provide a valuable price discovery mechanism that reflects the collective views of all market participants with regard to the future supply and demand prospects of a commodity. Given the financial (versus physical) nature of their contract execution, commodity exchanges allow important parties beyond traditional suppliers and buyers—speculators, arbitrageurs, private equity, endowments, and other institutional investors—to participate in these price discovery and risk transfer processes. Standardized contracts and organized exchanges also offer liquidity (i.e., trading volumes) to facilitate closing, reducing, expanding, or opening new hedges or exposures as circumstances change on a daily basis. Forward markets exist alongside futures markets in certain commodities for use by entities that require customization in contract terms. Forwards are largely outside the scope of this reading and are discussed only briefly. Exposure to commodities is also traded in the swap markets for both speculative and hedging purposes. Investment managers may want to establish swap positions to match certain portfolio needs, whereas producers may want to more precisely adjust their commodity risk (e.g., the origin of their cattle or the chemical specifications of their crude oil). Commodities offer the potential for diversification benefits in a multi-asset class portfolio because of historically low average return correlation with stocks and bonds. In addition, certain academic studies (e.g., Gorton and Rouwenhorst 2006; Erb and Harvey 2006) demonstrate that some commodities have historically had inflation hedging qualities. Our coverage of the commodities topic is organized as follows: We provide an overview of physical commodity markets, including the major sectors, their life cycles, and their valuation. We then describe futures market participants, commodity futures pricing, and the analysis of commodity returns, including the concepts of contango and backwardation. The subsequent section reviews the use of swap instruments rather than futures to gain exposure to commodities. We then review the various commodity indexes given their importance as benchmarks for the asset class and investment vehicles. Finally, we conclude with a summary of the major points.","The member should be able to: compare characteristics of commodity sectors; compare the life cycle of commodity sectors from production through trading or consumption; contrast the valuation of commodities with the valuation of equities and bonds; describe types of participants in commodity futures markets; analyze the relationship between spot prices and futures prices in markets in contango and markets in backwardation; compare theories of commodity futures returns; describe, calculate, and interpret the components of total return for a fully collateralized commodity futures contract; contrast roll return in markets in contango and markets in backwardation; describe how commodity swaps are used to obtain or modify exposure to commodities; describe how the construction of commodity indexes affects index returns.","Commodities are a diverse asset class comprising various sectors: energy, grains, industrial (base) metals, livestock, precious metals, and softs (cash crops). Each of these sectors has a number of characteristics that are important in determining the supply and demand for each commodity, including ease of storage, geopolitics, and weather. Fundamental analysis of commodities relies on analyzing supply and demand for each of the products as well as estimating the reaction to the inevitable shocks to their equilibrium or underlying direction. The life cycle of commodities varies considerably depending on the economic, technical, and structural (i.e., industry, value chain) profile of each commodity as well as the sector. A short life cycle allows for relatively rapid adjustment to outside events, whereas a long life cycle generally limits the ability of the market to react. The valuation of commodities relative to that of equities and bonds can be summarized by noting that equities and bonds represent financial assets whereas commodities are physical assets. The valuation of commodities is not based on the estimation of future profitability and cash flows but rather on a discounted forecast of future possible prices based on such factors as the supply and demand of the physical item. The commodity trading environment is similar to other asset classes, with three types of trading participants: (1) informed investors/hedgers, (2) speculators, and (3) arbitrageurs. Commodities have two general pricing forms: spot prices in the physical markets and futures prices for later delivery. The spot price is the current price to deliver or purchase a physical commodity at a specific location. A futures price is an exchange-based price agreed on to deliver or receive a defined quantity and often quality of a commodity at a future date. The difference between spot and futures prices is generally called the basis. When the spot price is higher than the futures price, it is called backwardation, and when it is lower, it is called contango. Backwardation and contango are also used to describe the relationship between two futures contracts of the same commodity. Commodity contracts can be settled by either cash or physical delivery. There are three primary theories of futures returns. In insurance theory, commodity producers who are long the physical good are motived to sell the commodity for future delivery to hedge their production price risk exposure. The hedging pressure hypothesis describes when producers along with consumers seek to protect themselves from commodity market price volatility by entering into price hedges to stabilize their projected profits and cash flow. The theory of storage focuses on supply and demand dynamics of commodity inventories, including the concept of “convenience yield.” The total return of a fully collateralized commodity futures contract can be quantified as the spot price return plus the roll return plus the collateral return (risk-free rate return). The roll return is effectively the weighted accounting difference (in percentage terms) between the near-term commodity futures contract price and the farther-term commodity futures contract price. A commodity swap is a legal contract between two parties calling for the exchange of payments over multiple dates as determined by several reference prices or indexes. The most relevant commodity swaps include excess return swaps, total return swaps, basis swaps, and variance/volatility swaps. The five primary commodity indexes based on assets are (1) the S&P GSCI; (2) the Bloomberg Commodity Index, formerly the Dow Jones–UBS Commodity Index; (3) the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index; (4) the Thomson Reuters/CoreCommodity CRB Index; and (5) the Rogers International Commodities Index. The key differentiating characteristics of commodity indexes are the breadth and selection methodology of coverage (number of commodities and sectors) included in each index, noting that some commodities have multiple reference contracts, the relative weightings assigned to each component/commodity and the related methodology for how these weights are determined, the methodology and frequency for rolling the individual futures contracts, the methodology and frequency for rebalancing the weights of the individual commodities and sectors, and the governance that determines which commodities are selected.

A forward contract is a promise to buy or sell an asset at a future date at a price agreed to at the contract’s initiation. The forward contract has a linear payoff function, with both upside and downside risk. A swap is essentially a promise to undertake a transaction at a set price or rate at several dates in the future. The technique we use to price and value swaps is to identify and construct a portfolio with cash flows equivalent to those of the swap. Then, we can use tools, such as the law of one price, to determine swap values from simpler financial instruments, such as a pair of bonds with a cash flow pattern similar to those of our swap. Look out for the big picture: value additivity, arbitrage, and the law of one price are important valuation concepts. Forwards and swaps are widely used in practice to manage a broad range of market risks. As well, more complex derivative instruments can sometimes be understood in terms of their basic building blocks: forwards and option-based components. Here are just some of the many and varied uses for forwards, futures, and swaps that you might encounter in your investment career: Use of equity index futures and swaps by a private wealth manager to hedge equity risk in a low tax basis, concentrated position in his high-net-worth client’s portfolio. Use of interest rate swaps by a defined benefits plan manager to hedge interest rate risk and to manage the pension plan’s duration gap. Use of derivatives (total return swaps, equity futures, bond futures, etc.) overlays by a university endowment for tactical asset allocation and portfolio rebalancing. Use of interest rate swaps by a corporate borrower to synthetically convert floating-rate debt securities to fixed-rate debt securities (or vice versa). Use of VIX futures and inflation swaps by a firm’s market strategist to infer expectations about market volatility and inflation rates, respectively.","The member should be able to: describe the carry arbitrage model without underlying cashflows and with underlying cashflows; describe how equity forwards and futures are priced, and calculate and interpret their no-arbitrage value; describe how interest rate forwards and futures are priced, and calculate and interpret their no-arbitrage value; describe how fixed-income forwards and futures are priced, and calculate and interpret their no-arbitrage value; describe how interest rate swaps are priced, and calculate and interpret their no-arbitrage value; describe how currency swaps are priced, and calculate and interpret their no-arbitrage value; describe how equity swaps are priced, and calculate and interpret their no-arbitrage value.","This reading on forward commitment pricing and valuation provides a foundation for understanding how forwards, futures, and swaps are both priced and valued. Key points include the following: The arbitrageur would rather have more money than less and abides by two fundamental rules: Do not use your own money, and do not take any price risk. The no-arbitrage approach is used for the pricing and valuation of forward commitments and is built on the key concept of the law of one price, which states that if two investments have the same future cash flows, regardless of what happens in the future, these two investments should have the same current price. Throughout this reading, the following key assumptions are made: Replicating and offsetting instruments are identifiable and investable. Market frictions are nil. Short selling is allowed with full use of proceeds. Borrowing and lending are available at a known risk-free rate. Carry arbitrage models used for forward commitment pricing and valuation are based on the no-arbitrage approach. With forward commitments, there is a distinct difference between pricing and valuation. Pricing involves the determination of the appropriate fixed price or rate, and valuation involves the determination of the contract’s current value expressed in currency units. Forward commitment pricing results in determining a price or rate such that the forward contract value is equal to zero. Using the carry arbitrage model, the forward contract price (F 0 ) is: F 0 = FV(S 0 ) = S 0 (1 + r) T (assuming annual compounding, r) F 0 = FV ( S 0 ) = S 0 exp r c T (assuming continuous compounding, r c ) The key forward commitment pricing equations with carry costs (CC) and carry benefits (CB) are: F 0 = FV[S 0 + CC 0 – CB 0 ] (with discrete compounding) F 0 = S 0 exp ( r c + CC − CB ) T (with continuous compounding) Futures contract pricing in this reading can essentially be treated the same as forward contract pricing. The value of a forward commitment is a function of the price of the underlying instrument, financing costs, and other carry costs and benefits. The key forward commitment valuation equations are: Long Forward: V t = PV [ F t − F 0 ] = [ F t − F 0 ] ( 1 + r ) T − t and Short Forward: − V t = PV [ F 0 − F t ] = [ F 0 − F t ] ( 1 + r ) T − t , With the PV of the difference in forward prices adjusted for carry costs and benefits. Alternatively, Long Forward: V t = S t − P V [ F 0 ] = S t − F 0 ( 1 + r ) T − t and Short Forward: − V t = PV [ F 0 ] − S t = F 0 ( 1 + r ) T − t − S t With equities and fixed-income securities, the forward price is determined such that the initial forward value is zero. A forward rate agreement (FRA) is a forward contract on interest rates. The FRA’s fixed interest rate is determined such that the initial value of the FRA is zero. FRA settlements amounts at Time h are: Pay-fixed (Long): NA × {[L m – FRA 0 ] t m }/[1 + D m t m ] and Receive-fixed (Short): NA × {FRA 0 – L m ] t m }/[1 + D m t m ]. The FRA’s fixed interest rate (annualized) at contract initiation is: FRA 0 = {[1 + L T t T ]/[1 + L h t h ] – 1}/t m . The Time g value of an FRA initiated at Time 0 is: Long FRA: V g = NA × {[FRA g – FRA 0 ] t m }/[1+ D (T–g) t (T–g) ] and Short FRA: –V g = NA × {[FRA 0 – FRA g ] t m }/[1+ D (T–g) t (T–g) ]. The fixed-income forward (or futures) price including conversion factor (i.e., adjusted price) is: F 0 = Q 0 × CF = FV[S 0 + CC 0 – CB 0 ] = FV[B 0 + AI 0 – PVCI], and the conversion factor adjusted futures price (i.e., quoted futures price) is: Q 0 = [1/CF] {FV [B 0 + AI 0 ] – AI T – FVCI}. The general approach to pricing and valuing swaps as covered here is using a replicating portfolio or offsetting portfolio of comparable instruments, typically bonds for interest rate and currency swaps and equities plus bonds for equity swaps. The swap pricing equation, which sets r FIX for the implied fixed bond in an interest rate swap, is: r F I X = 1 − PV n ( 1 ) ∑ i = 1 n PV i ( 1 ) . The value of an interest rate swap at a point in Time t after initiation is the sum of the present values of the difference in fixed swap rates times the stated notional amount, or: V S W A P , t = NA × ( FS 0 − FS t ) × ∑ i = 1 n PV i (Value of receive-fixed swap) and − V S W A P , t = NA × ( FS t − FS 0 ) × ∑ i = 1 n PV i (Value of pay-fixed swap). With a basic understanding of pricing and valuing a simple interest rate swap, it is a straightforward extension to pricing and valuing currency swaps and equity swaps. The solution for each of the three variables, one notional amount (NA a ) and two fixed rates (one for each currency, a and b), needed to price a fixed-for-fixed currency swap are : NA a = S 0 × NA b; r a = 1 − PV n , a ( 1 ) ∑ i = 1 n PV i , a ( 1 ) and r b = 1 − PV n , b ( 1 ) ∑ i = 1 n PV i , b ( 1 ) . The currency swap valuation equation, for valuing the swap at time t (after initiation), can be expressed as: V C S = NA a ( r F i x , a ∑ i = 1 n PV i ( 1 ) + PV n ( 1 ) ) − S t NA b ( r F i x , b ∑ i = 1 n PV i ( 1 ) + PV n ( 1 ) ) . For a receive-fixed, pay equity swap, the fixed rate (r FIX ) for the implied fixed bond that makes the swap’s value (V EQ ) equal to “0” at initiation is: r F I X = 1 − P V n ( 1 ) ∑ i = 1 n P V i ( 1 ) . The value of an equity swap at Time t (V EQ,t ), after initiation, is: V EQ,t = V FIX (C 0 ) – (S t /S t–1 )NA E – PV(Par – NA E ) where V FIX (C 0 ) is the Time t value of a fixed-rate bond initiated with coupon C 0 at Time 0, S t is the current equity price, S t–1 is the equity price at the last reset date, and PV() is the PV function from the swap maturity date to Time t.

Valuation becomes more complicated when a bond has one or more embedded options because the values of embedded options are typically contingent on interest rates. Understanding how to value and analyze bonds with embedded options is important for practitioners. Issuers of bonds often manage interest rate exposure with embedded options, such as call provisions. Investors in callable bonds must appreciate the risk of being called. The perception of this risk is collectively represented by the premium, in terms of increased coupon or yield, that the market demands for callable bonds relative to otherwise identical option-free bonds. Issuers and investors must also understand how other types of embedded options—such as put provisions, conversion options, caps, and floors—affect bond values and the sensitivity of these bonds to interest rate movements. We first provide a brief overview of various types of embedded options. We then discuss bonds that include a call or put provision. Taking a building-block approach, we show how the arbitrage-free valuation framework discussed earlier can be applied to the valuation of callable and putable bonds—first in the absence of interest rate volatility, and then when interest rates fluctuate. We also discuss how option-adjusted spreads are used to value risky callable and putable bonds. We then turn to interest rate sensitivity. It highlights the need to use effective duration, including one-sided durations and key rate durations, as well as effective convexity to assess the effect of interest rate movements on the value of callable and putable bonds. We also explain the valuation of capped and floored floating-rate bonds (floaters) and convertible bonds.","The member should be able to: describe fixed-income securities with embedded options; explain the relationships between the values of a callable or putable bond, the underlying option-free (straight) bond, and the embedded option; describe how the arbitrage-free framework can be used to value a bond with embedded options; explain how interest rate volatility affects the value of a callable or putable bond; explain how changes in the level and shape of the yield curve affect the value of a callable or putable bond; calculate the value of a callable or putable bond from an interest rate tree; explain the calculation and use of option-adjusted spreads; explain how interest rate volatility affects option-adjusted spreads; calculate and interpret effective duration of a callable or putable bond; compare effective durations of callable, putable, and straight bonds; describe the use of one-sided durations and key rate durations to evaluate the interest rate sensitivity of bonds with embedded options; compare effective convexities of callable, putable, and straight bonds; calculate the value of a capped or floored floating-rate bond; describe defining features of a convertible bond; calculate and interpret the components of a convertible bond’s value; describe how a convertible bond is valued in an arbitrage-free framework; compare the risk–return characteristics of a convertible bond with the risk–return characteristics of a straight bond and of the underlying common stock.","An embedded option represents a right that can be exercised by the issuer, by the bondholder, or automatically depending on the course of interest rates. It is attached to, or embedded in, an underlying option-free bond called a straight bond. Simple embedded option structures include call options, put options, and extension options. Callable and putable bonds can be redeemed prior to maturity, at the discretion of the issuer in the former case and of the bondholder in the latter case. An extendible bond gives the bondholder the right to keep the bond for a number of years after maturity. Putable and extendible bonds are equivalent, except that their underlying option-free bonds are different. Complex embedded option structures include bonds with other types of options or combinations of options. For example, a convertible bond includes a conversion option that allows the bondholders to convert their bonds into the issuer’s common stock. A bond with an estate put can be put by the heirs of a deceased bondholder. Sinking fund bonds make the issuer set aside funds over time to retire the bond issue and are often callable, may have an acceleration provision, and may also contain a delivery option. Valuing and analyzing bonds with complex embedded option structures is challenging. According to the arbitrage-free framework, the value of a bond with an embedded option is equal to the arbitrage-free values of its parts—that is, the arbitrage-free value of the straight bond and the arbitrage-free values of each of the embedded options. Because the call option is an issuer option, the value of the call option decreases the value of the callable bond relative to an otherwise identical but non-callable bond. In contrast, because the put option is an investor option, the value of the put option increases the value of the putable bond relative to an otherwise identical but non-putable bond. In the absence of default and interest rate volatility, the bond’s future cash flows are certain. Thus, the value of a callable or putable bond can be calculated by discounting the bond’s future cash flows at the appropriate one-period forward rates, taking into consideration the decision to exercise the option. If a bond is callable, the decision to exercise the option is made by the issuer, which will exercise the call option when the value of the bond’s future cash flows is higher than the call price. In contrast, if the bond is putable, the decision to exercise the option is made by the bondholder, who will exercise the put option when the value of the bond’s future cash flows is lower than the put price. In practice, interest rates fluctuate and interest rate volatility affects the value of embedded options. Thus, when valuing bonds with embedded options, it is important to consider the possible evolution of the yield curve over time. Interest rate volatility is modeled using a binomial interest rate tree. The higher the volatility, the lower the value of the callable bond and the higher the value of the putable bond. Valuing a bond with embedded options assuming an interest rate volatility requires three steps: (1) Generate a tree of interest rates based on the given yield curve and volatility assumptions; (2) at each node of the tree, determine whether the embedded options will be exercised; and (3) apply the backward induction valuation methodology to calculate the present value of the bond. The option-adjusted spread is the single spread added uniformly to the one-period forward rates on the tree to produce a value or price for a bond. OAS is sensitive to interest rate volatility: The higher the volatility, the lower the OAS for a callable bond. For bonds with embedded options, the best measure to assess the sensitivity of the bond’s price to a parallel shift of the benchmark yield curve is effective duration. The effective duration of a callable or putable bond cannot exceed that of the straight bond. When the option is near the money, the convexity of a callable bond is negative, indicating that the upside for a callable bond is much smaller than the downside, whereas the convexity of a putable bond is positive, indicating that the upside for a putable bond is much larger than the downside. Because the prices of callable and putable bonds respond asymmetrically to upward and downward interest rate changes of the same magnitude, one-sided durations provide a better indication regarding the interest rate sensitivity of bonds with embedded options than (two-sided) effective duration. Key rate durations show the effect of shifting only key points, one at a time, rather than the entire yield curve. The arbitrage-free framework can be used to value capped and floored floaters. The cap provision in a floater is an issuer option that prevents the coupon rate from increasing above a specified maximum rate. Thus, the value of a capped floater is equal to or less than the value of the straight bond. In contrast, the floor provision in a floater is an investor option that prevents the coupon from decreasing below a specified minimum rate. Thus, the value of a floored floater is equal to or higher than the value of the straight bond. The characteristics of a convertible bond include the conversion price, which is the applicable share price at which the bondholders can convert their bonds into common shares, and the conversion ratio, which reflects the number of shares of common stock that the bondholders receive from converting their bonds into shares. The conversion price is adjusted in case of corporate actions, such as stock splits, bonus share issuances, and rights and warrants issuances. Convertible bondholders may receive compensation when the issuer pays dividends to its common shareholders, and they may be given the opportunity to either put their bonds or convert their bonds into shares earlier and at more advantageous terms in the case of a change of control. A number of investment metrics and ratios help analyze and value convertible bonds. The conversion value indicates the value of the bond if it is converted at the market price of the shares. The minimum value of a convertible bond sets a floor value for the convertible bond at the greater of the conversion value or the straight value. This floor is moving, however, because the straight value is not fixed. The market conversion premium represents the price investors effectively pay for the underlying shares if they buy the convertible bond and then convert it into shares. Scaled by the market price of the shares, it represents the premium payable when buying the convertible bond rather than the underlying common stock. Because convertible bonds combine characteristics of bonds, stocks, and options, as well as potentially other features, their valuation and analysis are challenging. Convertible bond investors should consider the factors that affect not only bond prices but also the underlying share price. The arbitrage-free framework can be used to value convertible bonds, including callable and putable ones. Each component (straight bond, call option of the stock, and call and/or put option on the bond) can be valued separately. The risk–return characteristics of a convertible bond depend on the underlying share price relative to the conversion price. When the underlying share price is well below the conversion price, the convertible bond is “busted” and exhibits mostly bond risk–return characteristics. Thus, it is mainly sensitive to interest rate movements. In contrast, when the underlying share price is well above the conversion price, the convertible bond exhibits mostly stock risk–return characteristics. Thus, its price follows similar movements to the price of the underlying stock. In between these two extremes, the convertible bond trades like a hybrid instrument.

The income statement communicates how much revenue the company generated during a period and what costs it incurred in connection with generating that revenue. The basic equation underlying the income statement, ignoring gains and losses, is Revenue minus Expenses equals Net income. The income statement is also sometimes referred to as the “statement of operations,” “statement of earnings,” or “profit and loss (P&L) statement.” Under both International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and US generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP), the income statement may be presented as a separate statement followed by a statement of comprehensive income that begins with the profit or loss from the income statement or as a section of a single statement of comprehensive income. This reading focuses on the income statement, and the term income statement will be used to describe either the separate statement that reports profit or loss used for earnings per share calculations or that section of a statement of comprehensive income that reports the same profit or loss. The reading also includes a discussion of comprehensive income (profit or loss from the income statement plus other comprehensive income). Investment analysts intensely scrutinize companies’ income statements. Equity analysts are interested in them because equity markets often reward relatively high- or low-earnings growth companies with above-average or below-average valuations, respectively, and because inputs into valuation models often include estimates of earnings. Fixed-income analysts examine the components of income statements, past and projected, for information on companies’ abilities to make promised payments on their debt over the course of the business cycle. Corporate financial announcements frequently emphasize information reported in income statements, particularly earnings, more than information reported in the other financial statements. This reading is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the components of the income statement and its format. Section 3 describes basic principles and selected applications related to the recognition of revenue, and Section 4 describes basic principles and selected applications related to the recognition of expenses. Section 5 covers non-recurring items and non-operating items. Section 6 explains the calculation of earnings per share. Section 7 introduces income statement analysis, and Section 8 explains comprehensive income and its reporting. A summary of the key points and practice problems in the CFA Institute multiple choice format complete the reading.","The member should be able to: describe the components of the income statement and alternative presentation formats of that statement; Describe general principles of revenue recognition and accounting standards for revenue recognition; calculate revenue given information that might influence the choice of revenue recognition method; describe general principles of expense recognition, specific expense recognition applications, and implications of expense recognition choices for financial analysis; describe the financial reporting treatment and analysis of non-recurring items (including discontinued operations, unusual or infrequent items) and changes in accounting policies; distinguish between the operating and non-operating components of the income statement; describe how earnings per share is calculated and calculate and interpret a company’s earnings per share (both basic and diluted earnings per share) for both simple and complex capital structures; distinguish between dilutive and antidilutive securities and describe the implications of each for the earnings per share calculation; convert income statements to common-size income statements; evaluate a company’s financial performance using common-size income statements and financial ratios based on the income statement; describe, calculate, and interpret comprehensive income; describe other comprehensive income and identify major types of items included in it.","This reading has presented the elements of income statement analysis. The income statement presents information on the financial results of a company’s business activities over a period of time; it communicates how much revenue the company generated during a period and what costs it incurred in connection with generating that revenue. A company’s net income and its components (e.g., gross margin, operating earnings, and pretax earnings) are critical inputs into both the equity and credit analysis processes. Equity analysts are interested in earnings because equity markets often reward relatively high- or low-earnings growth companies with above-average or below-average valuations, respectively. Fixed-income analysts examine the components of income statements, past and projected, for information on companies’ abilities to make promised payments on their debt over the course of the business cycle. Corporate financial announcements frequently emphasize income statements more than the other financial statements. Key points to this reading include the following: The income statement presents revenue, expenses, and net income. The components of the income statement include: revenue; cost of sales; sales, general, and administrative expenses; other operating expenses; non-operating income and expenses; gains and losses; non-recurring items; net income; and EPS. An income statement that presents a subtotal for gross profit (revenue minus cost of goods sold) is said to be presented in a multi-step format. One that does not present this subtotal is said to be presented in a single-step format. Revenue is recognized in the period it is earned, which may or may not be in the same period as the related cash collection. Recognition of revenue when earned is a fundamental principal of accrual accounting. An analyst should identify differences in companies’ revenue recognition methods and adjust reported revenue where possible to facilitate comparability. Where the available information does not permit adjustment, an analyst can characterize the revenue recognition as more or less conservative and thus qualitatively assess how differences in policies might affect financial ratios and judgments about profitability. As of the beginning of 2018, revenue recognition standards have converged. The core principle of the converged standards is that revenue should be recognized to “depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in an exchange for those goods or services.” To achieve the core principle, the standard describes the application of five steps in recognizing revenue. The standard also specifies the treatment of some related contract costs and disclosure requirements. The general principles of expense recognition include a process to match expenses either to revenue (such as, cost of goods sold) or to the time period in which the expenditure occurs (period costs such as, administrative salaries) or to the time period of expected benefits of the expenditures (such as, depreciation). In expense recognition, choice of method (i.e., depreciation method and inventory cost method), as well as estimates (i.e., uncollectible accounts, warranty expenses, assets’ useful life, and salvage value) affect a company’s reported income. An analyst should identify differences in companies’ expense recognition methods and adjust reported financial statements where possible to facilitate comparability. Where the available information does not permit adjustment, an analyst can characterize the policies and estimates as more or less conservative and thus qualitatively assess how differences in policies might affect financial ratios and judgments about companies’ performance. To assess a company’s future earnings, it is helpful to separate those prior years’ items of income and expense that are likely to continue in the future from those items that are less likely to continue. Under IFRS, a company should present additional line items, headings, and subtotals beyond those specified when such presentation is relevant to an understanding of the entity’s financial performance. Some items from prior years clearly are not expected to continue in future periods and are separately disclosed on a company’s income statement. Under US GAAP, unusual and/or infrequently occurring items, which are material, are presented separately within income from continuing operations. Non-operating items are reported separately from operating items on the income statement. Under both IFRS and US GAAP, the income statement reports separately the effect of the disposal of a component operation as a “discontinued” operation. Basic EPS is the amount of income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding over a period. The amount of income available to common shareholders is the amount of net income remaining after preferred dividends (if any) have been paid. If a company has a simple capital structure (i.e., one with no potentially dilutive securities), then its basic EPS is equal to its diluted EPS. If, however, a company has dilutive securities, its diluted EPS is lower than its basic EPS. Diluted EPS is calculated using the if-converted method for convertible securities and the treasury stock method for options. Common-size analysis of the income statement involves stating each line item on the income statement as a percentage of sales. Common-size statements facilitate comparison across time periods and across companies of different sizes. Two income-statement-based indicators of profitability are net profit margin and gross profit margin. Comprehensive income includes both net income and other revenue and expense items that are excluded from the net income calculation.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L2V5R6-private-equity-investments.pdf,Alternative Investments,2023,Level II,"Private equity’s shift from a niche activity to a critical component of the financial system is evident from investors’ financial commitment: around $2.8 trillion globally as of mid-2018. And that’s just the equity portion. The use of debt means transaction value is often two or three times the actual equity raised. Blackstone, Carlyle, and KKR are household names and publicly traded companies of significant size. Private equity funds may account for 15%–18% of the value of all mergers and acquisitions, and the market capitalization of Alibaba, Amazon, Facebook, and Google has raised the profile of venture capital investing. We take two approaches to illuminate our subject: In Section 2 the perspective is primarily that of the private equity firm evaluating potential investments. Valuing acquisitions is particularly complex; except for public-to-private transactions, there will be no market prices to refer to, and the challenges are considerable. In Section 3 we take the perspective of an outside investor investing in a fund sponsored by the private equity firm. Definitions of private equity differ, but here we include the entire asset class of equity investments that are not quoted on stock markets. Private equity stretches from venture capital (VC)—working with early-stage companies that may be without revenues but that possess good ideas or technology—to growth equity, providing capital to expand established private businesses often by taking a minority interest, all the way to large buyouts (leveraged buyouts, or LBOs), in which the private equity firm buys the entire company. When the target is publicly traded, the private equity fund performs a public-to-private transaction, removing the target from the stock market. But buyout transactions usually involve private companies and very often a particular division of an existing company. Some exclude venture capital from the private equity universe because of the higher risk profile of backing new companies as opposed to mature ones. For this reading, we refer simply to venture capital and buyouts as the two main forms of private equity. Many classifications of private equity are available. Classifications proposed by the European and Private Equity Venture Capital Association (EVCA) are displayed in Exhibit 1. Exhibit 1. Classification of Private Equity in Terms of Stage and Type of Financing of Portfolio Companies Broad Category Subcategory Brief Description Venture capital Seed stage Financing provided to research business ideas, develop prototype products, or conduct market research Start-up stage Financing to recently created companies with well-articulated business and marketing plans Later (expansion) stage Financing to companies that have started their selling effort and may already be covering costs: Financing may serve to expand production capacity, product development, or provide working capital. Replacement capital Financing provided to purchase shares from other existing venture capital investors or to reduce financial leverage. Growth Expansion capital Financing to established and mature companies in exchange for equity, often a minority stake, to expand into new markets and/or improve operations Buyout Acquisition capital Financing in the form of debt, equity, or quasi-equity provided to a company to acquire another company Leveraged buyout Financing provided by an LBO firm to acquire a company Management buyout Financing provided to the management to acquire a company, specific product line, or division (carve-out) Special situations Mezzanine finance Financing generally provided in the form of subordinated debt and an equity kicker (warrants, equity, etc.) frequently in the context of LBO transactions Distressed/turnaround Financing of companies in need of restructuring or facing financial distress One-time opportunities Financing in relation to changing industry trends and new government regulations Other Other forms of private equity financing are also possible—for example, activist investing, funds of funds, and secondaries. Private equity funds may also be classified geographically, by sector, or both. Certain specialists target real asset classes, such as real estate, infrastructure, energy, and timber, or they seek out emerging or niche sectors, such as agribusiness or royalties in pharmaceuticals, music, film, or TV. US private equity enjoyed a far larger market size historically than private equity in other regions, with few restrictions on hostile takeovers. Buyouts subsequently expanded to Europe and then Asia as friendly deals became commonplace. In broad terms, around four-fifths of the money has been flowing into buyout, growth, and other types of private equity in both the United States and Europe, with buyout amounts far exceeding other types. The sheer scale of buyouts means that an individual deal can absorb billions of dollars in capital. Buyout funds have benefited from increased allocations given their ability to absorb far higher capital amounts and to deliver historically higher-than-average returns. Venture capital deals, in contrast, tend to drip, providing small amounts of feed money. Still, advances in technology and communications are causing the number of venture capital funds and the availability of start-up capital to grow. Investor attention started to shift to China in 2015, an especially active year for raising capital. VC funds targeting Asia had more than US$200 billion in 2017, up from US$50 billion in 2010. Most private equity money comes from institutional investors, such as pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, and insurance companies, although many family offices and high-net-worth individuals also invest directly or through fund-of-funds intermediaries. Venture capital investors include government agencies and corporations seeking to promote regional investment or gain insight into, and possibly control of, emerging businesses and technologies. Private equity investment is characterized by a buy-to-sell orientation: Investors typically expect their money to be returned, with a handsome profit, within 10 years of committing their funds. The economic incentives of the funds are aligned with this goal.","The member should be able to: explain sources of value creation in private equity; explain how private equity firms align their interests with those of the managers of portfolio companies; distinguish between the characteristics of buyout and venture capital investments; interpret LBO model and VC method output; explain alternative exit routes in private equity and their impact on value; explain risks and costs of investing in private equity; explain private equity fund structures, terms, due diligence, and valuation in the context of an analysis of private equity fund returns; interpret and compare financial performance of private equity funds from the perspective of an investor; calculate management fees, carried interest, net asset value, distributed to paid in (DPI), residual value to paid in (RVPI), and total value to paid in (TVPI) of a private equity fund.","Private equity funds seek to add value by various means, including optimizing financial structures, incentivizing management, and creating operational improvements. Private equity can be thought of as an alternative system of governance for corporations: Rather than ownership and control being separated as in most publicly quoted companies, private equity concentrates ownership and control. Many view the combination of ownership and control as a fundamental source of the returns earned by the best private equity funds. A critical role for the GP is valuation of potential investments. But because these investments are usually privately owned, valuation encounters many challenges. Valuation techniques differ according to the nature of the investment. Early-stage ventures require very different techniques than leveraged buyouts. Private equity professionals tend to use multiple techniques when performing a valuation, and they explore many different scenarios for the future development of the business. In buyouts, the availability of debt financing can have a big impact on the scale of private equity activity, and it seems to impact valuations observed in the market. Because private equity funds are incentivized to acquire, add value, and then exit within the lifetime of the fund, they are considered buy-to-sell investors. Planning the exit route for the investment is a critical role for the GP, and a well-timed and well-executed investment can be a significant source of realized value. In addition to the problems encountered by the private equity funds in valuing potential portfolio investments, challenges exist in valuing the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis. This is because the investments have no easily observed market value and there is a large element of judgment involved in valuing each of the portfolio companies prior to their sale by the fund. The two main metrics for measuring the ongoing and ultimate performance of private equity funds are IRR and multiples. Comparisons of PE returns across funds and with other assets are demanding because it is important to control for the timing of cash flows, differences in risk and portfolio composition, and vintage-year effects.

Machine learning techniques, a central part of that technology, are the subject of this reading. These techniques first appeared in finance in the 1990s and have since flourished with the explosion of data and cheap computing power. This reading provides a high-level view of machine learning (ML). It covers a selection of key ML algorithms and their investment applications. Investment practitioners should be equipped with a basic understanding of the types of investment problems that machine learning can address, an idea of how the algorithms work, and the vocabulary to interact with machine learning and data science experts. While investment practitioners need not master the details and mathematics of machine learning, as domain experts in investments they can play an important role in the implementation of these techniques by being able to source appropriate model inputs, interpret model outputs, and translate outputs into appropriate investment actions. Section 1 gives an overview of machine learning in investment management. Section 2 defines machine learning and the types of problems that can be addressed by supervised and unsupervised learning. Section 3 describes evaluating machine learning algorithm performance. Key supervised machine learning algorithms are covered in Sections 4–8, and Sections 9–12 describe key unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Neural networks, deep learning nets, and reinforcement learning are covered in Sections 13 and 14. Section 15 provides a decision flowchart for selecting the appropriate ML algorithm. The reading concludes with a summary.","The member should be able to: describe supervised machine learning, unsupervised machine learning, and deep learning; describe overfitting and identify methods of addressing it; describe supervised machine learning algorithms—including penalized regression, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, classification and regression tree, ensemble learning, and random forest—and determine the problems for which they are best suited; describe unsupervised machine learning algorithms—including principal components analysis, k-means clustering, and hierarchical clustering—and determine the problems for which they are best suited; describe neural networks, deep learning nets, and reinforcement learning","Machine learning methods are gaining usage at many stages in the investment management value chain. Among the major points made are the following: Machine learning aims at extracting knowledge from large amounts of data by learning from known examples to determine an underlying structure in the data. The emphasis is on generating structure or predictions without human intervention. An elementary way to think of ML algorithms is to “find the pattern, apply the pattern.” Supervised learning depends on having labeled training data as well as matched sets of observed inputs ( X ’s, or features) and the associated output ( Y , or target). Supervised learning can be divided into two categories: regression and classification. If the target variable to be predicted is continuous, then the task is one of regression. If the target variable is categorical or ordinal (e.g., determining a firm’s rating), then it is a classification problem. With unsupervised learning, algorithms are trained with no labeled data, so they must infer relations between features, summarize them, or present underlying structure in their distributions that has not been explicitly provided. Two important types of problems well suited to unsupervised ML are dimension reduction and clustering. In deep learning, sophisticated algorithms address complex tasks (e.g., image classification, natural language processing). Deep learning is based on neural networks, highly flexible ML algorithms for solving a variety of supervised and unsupervised tasks characterized by large datasets, non-linearities, and interactions among features. In reinforcement learning, a computer learns from interacting with itself or data generated by the same algorithm. Generalization describes the degree to which an ML model retains its explanatory power when predicting out-of-sample. Overfitting, a primary reason for lack of generalization, is the tendency of ML algorithms to tailor models to the training data at the expense of generalization to new data points. Bias error is the degree to which a model fits the training data. Variance error describes how much a model’s results change in response to new data from validation and test samples. Base error is due to randomness in the data. Out-of-sample error equals bias error plus variance error plus base error. K -fold cross-validation is a technique for mitigating the holdout sample problem (excessive reduction of the training set size). The data (excluding test sample and fresh data) are shuffled randomly and then divided into k equal sub-samples, with k – 1 samples used as training samples and one sample, the k th, used as a validation sample. Regularization describes methods that reduce statistical variability in high-dimensional data estimation or prediction problems via reducing model complexity. LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) is a popular type of penalized regression where the penalty term involves summing the absolute values of the regression coefficients. The greater the number of included features, the larger the penalty. So, a feature must make a sufficient contribution to model fit to offset the penalty from including it. Support vector machine (SVM) is a classifier that aims to seek the optimal hyperplane—the one that separates the two sets of data points by the maximum margin (and thus is typically used for classification). K -nearest neighbor (KNN) is a supervised learning technique most often used for classification. The idea is to classify a new observation by finding similarities (“nearness”) between it and its k-nearest neighbors in the existing dataset. Classification and regression tree (CART) can be applied to predict either a categorical target variable, producing a classification tree, or a continuous target variable, producing a regression tree. A binary CART is a combination of an initial root node, decision nodes, and terminal nodes. The root node and each decision node represent a single feature ( f ) and a cutoff value ( c ) for that feature. The CART algorithm iteratively partitions the data into sub-groups until terminal nodes are formed that contain the predicted label. Ensemble learning is a technique of combining the predictions from a collection of models. It typically produces more accurate and more stable predictions than any single model. A random forest classifier is a collection of many different decision trees generated by a bagging method or by randomly reducing the number of features available during training. Principal components analysis (PCA) is an unsupervised ML algorithm that reduces highly correlated features into fewer uncorrelated composite variables by transforming the feature covariance matrix. PCA produces eigenvectors that define the principal components (i.e., the new uncorrelated composite variables) and eigenvalues, which give the proportion of total variance in the initial data that is explained by each eigenvector and its associated principal component. K-means is an unsupervised ML algorithm that partitions observations into a fixed number (k) of non-overlapping clusters. Each cluster is characterized by its centroid, and each observation belongs to the cluster with the centroid to which that observation is closest. Hierarchical clustering is an unsupervised iterative algorithm that is used to build a hierarchy of clusters. Two main strategies are used to define the intermediary clusters (i.e., those clusters between the initial dataset and the final set of clustered data). Agglomerative (bottom-up) hierarchical clustering begins with each observation being its own cluster. Then, the algorithm finds the two closest clusters, defined by some measure of distance, and combines them into a new, larger cluster. This process is repeated until all observations are clumped into a single cluster. Divisive (top-down) hierarchical clustering starts with all observations belonging to a single cluster. The observations are then divided into two clusters based on some measure of distance. The algorithm then progressively partitions the intermediate clusters into smaller clusters until each cluster contains only one observation. Neural networks consist of nodes connected by links. They have three types of layers: an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer. Learning takes place in the hidden layer nodes, each of which consists of a summation operator and an activation function. Neural networks have been successfully applied to a variety of investment tasks characterized by non-linearities and complex interactions among variables. Neural networks with many hidden layers (at least 2 but often more than 20) are known as deep neural networks (DNNs) and are the backbone of the artificial intelligence revolution. Reinforcement learning (RL) involves an agent that should perform actions that will maximize its rewards over time, taking into consideration the constraints of its environment.

Private companies are those whose shares are not listed on public markets. Generalist investment practitioners need to be familiar with issues associated with valuations of such companies. We use the terms “valuation” and “appraisal” interchangeably in this chapter. Many public companies have start-up or other operations that can best be valued as if they were private companies. Companies may grow through the acquisition of competitors, including private companies, and analysts must be prepared to evaluate the price paid in such transactions. Furthermore, acquisitions often result in significant balances of intangible assets, including goodwill, that are reported on the balance sheets of acquiring companies. Goodwill balances require impairment assessment or formal testing on an annual basis under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and US GAAP. Impairment testing and other financial reporting initiatives increasingly result in the use of fair value estimates in financial statements. The concepts and methods we will discuss play important roles in this aspect of financial reporting. In addition, issues relating to private company valuation arise in the types of investment held by venture capital and other types of private equity funds. The following sections illustrate key elements associated with the valuation of private companies and provide background for understanding private company valuation, including typical contrasts between public and private companies and the major purposes for which private valuations are performed. Later sections discuss earnings normalization and cash flow estimation; introduce the three major approaches recognized in private company valuation, valuation discounts, and premiums; and explain business valuation standards and practices.","The member should be able to: compare public and private company valuation; describe uses of private business valuation and explain applications of greatest concern to financial analysts; explain the income, market, and asset-based approaches to private company valuation and factors relevant to the selection of each approach; explain cash flow estimation issues related to private companies and adjustments required to estimate normalized earnings; calculate the value of a private company using free cash flow, capitalized cash flow, and/or excess earnings methods; explain factors that require adjustment when estimating the discount rate for private companies; compare models used to estimate the required rate of return to private company equity (for example, the CAPM, the expanded CAPM, and the build-up approach); calculate the value of a private company based on market approach methods and describe advantages and disadvantages of each method; describe the asset-based approach to private company valuation; explain and evaluate the effects on private company valuations of discounts and premiums based on control and marketability.","We have provided an overview of key elements of private company valuation and contrasted public and private company valuations. Company- and stock-specific factors may influence the selection of appropriate valuation methods and assumptions for private company valuations. Stock-specific factors may result in a lower value for an equity interest in a private company relative to a public company. Company-specific factors in which private companies differ from public companies include: stage in life cycle; size; overlap of shareholders and management; quality/depth of management; quality of financial and other information; pressure from short-term investors; and tax concerns. Stock-specific factors that frequently affect the value of private companies include liquidity of equity interests in business; concentration of control; and potential agreements restricting liquidity. Private company valuations are typically performed for three different reasons: transactions, compliance (financial or tax reporting), or litigation. Acquisition-related valuation issues and financial reporting valuation issues are of greatest importance in assessing public companies. Different definitions (standards) of value exist. The use of a valuation and key elements pertaining to the appraised company will help determine the appropriate definition. Key definitions of value include fair market value; market value; fair value for financial reporting; fair value in a litigation context; investment value; and intrinsic value. Private company valuations may require adjustments to the income statement to develop estimates of the company’s normalized earnings. Adjustments may be required for non-recurring, non-economic, or other unusual items to eliminate anomalies and/or facilitate comparisons. Within the income approach, the FCF method is frequently used to value larger, mature private companies. For smaller companies or in special situations, the capitalized cash flow method and residual income method may also be used. Within the market approach, three methods are regularly used: the guideline public company method, guideline transactions method, and prior transactions method. An asset-based approach is infrequently used in valuing private companies. This approach may be appropriate for companies that are worth more in liquidation than as going concerns. This approach is also applied for asset holding companies, very small companies, or companies formed recently that have limited operating histories. Control and marketability issues are important and challenging elements in the valuation of private companies and equity interests therein. If publicly traded companies are used as the basis for pricing multiple(s), control premiums may be appropriate in measuring the total equity value of a private company. Control premiums have also been used to estimate lack of control discounts. Discounts for lack of control are used to convert a controlling interest value into a non-controlling equity interest value. Evidence of the adverse impact of the lack of control is an important consideration in assessing this discount. Discounts for lack of marketability are often used in valuing non-controlling equity interests in private companies. A DLOM may be inappropriate if the company has a high likelihood of a liquidity event in the immediate future. Quantification of DLOMs can be challenging because of limited data, differences in the interpretation of available data, and different interpretations of the lack of marketability’s effect on a private company. DLOM can be estimated based on 1) private sales of restricted stock in public companies relative to their freely traded share price, 2) private sales of stock in companies prior to a subsequent IPO, and 3) the pricing of put options.

Price multiples are ratios of a stock’s market price to some measure of fundamental value per share. Enterprise value multiples , by contrast, relate the total market value of all sources of a company’s capital to a measure of fundamental value for the entire company. The intuition behind price multiples is that investors evaluate the price of a share of stock—judge whether it is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued—by considering what a share buys in terms of per share earnings, net assets, cash flow, or some other measure of value (stated on a per share basis). The intuition behind enterprise value multiples is similar; investors evaluate the market value of an entire enterprise relative to the amount of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), sales, or operating cash flow it generates. As valuation indicators (measures or indicators of value), multiples have the appealing qualities of simplicity in use and ease in communication. A multiple summarizes in a single number the relationship between the market value of a company’s stock (or of its total capital) and some fundamental quantity, such as earnings, sales, or book value (owners’ equity based on accounting values). Among the questions we will study for answers that will help in making correct use of multiples as valuation tools are the following: What accounting issues affect particular price and enterprise value multiples, and how can analysts address them? How do price multiples relate to fundamentals, such as earnings growth rates, and how can analysts use this information when making valuation comparisons among stocks? For which types of valuation problems is a particular price or enterprise value multiple appropriate or inappropriate? What challenges arise in applying price and enterprise value multiples internationally? Multiples may be viewed as valuation indicators relating to individual securities. Another type of valuation indicator used in security selection is momentum indicators . They typically relate either price or a fundamental (such as earnings) to the time series of its own past values or, in some cases, to its expected value. The logic behind the use of momentum indicators is that such indicators may provide information on future patterns of returns over some time horizon. Because the purpose of momentum indicators is to identify potentially rewarding investment opportunities, they can be viewed as a class of valuation indicators with a focus that is different from and complementary to the focus of price and enterprise value multiples. We first put the use of price and enterprise value multiples in an economic context and present certain themes common to the use of any price or enterprise value multiple. We then present price multiples. The treatment of each multiple follows a common format: usage considerations, the relationship of the multiple to investors’ expectations about fundamentals, and using the multiple in valuation based on comparables. The subsequent sections present enterprise value multiples, international considerations in using multiples, and treatment of momentum indicators. We then discuss several practical issues that arise in using valuation indicators.","The member should be able to: distinguish between the method of comparables and the method based on forecasted fundamentals as approaches to using price multiples in valuation and explain economic rationales for each approach; calculate and interpret a justified price multiple; describe rationales for and possible drawbacks to using alternative price multiples and dividend yield in valuation; calculate and interpret alternative price multiples and dividend yield; calculate and interpret underlying earnings, explain methods of normalizing earnings per share (EPS), and calculate normalized EPS; explain and justify the use of earnings yield (E/P); describe fundamental factors that influence alternative price multiples and dividend yield; calculate and interpret the justified price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), price-to-book ratio (P/B), and price-to-sales ratio (P/S) for a stock, based on forecasted fundamentals; calculate and interpret a predicted P/E, given a cross-sectional regression on fundamentals, and explain limitations to the cross-sectional regression methodology; evaluate a stock by the method of comparables and explain the importance of fundamentals in using the method of comparables; calculate and interpret the P/E-to-growth (PEG) ratio and explain its use in relative valuation; calculate and explain the use of price multiples in determining terminal value in a multistage discounted cash flow (DCF) model; explain alternative definitions of cash flow used in price and enterprise value (EV) multiples and describe limitations of each definition; calculate and interpret EV multiples and evaluate the use of EV/EBITDA; explain sources of differences in cross-border valuation comparisons; describe momentum indicators and their use in valuation; explain the use of the arithmetic mean, the harmonic mean, the weighted harmonic mean, and the median to describe the central tendency of a group of multiples; and evaluate whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued based on comparisons of multiples.","We have defined and explained the most important valuation indicators in professional use and illustrated their application to a variety of valuation problems. Price multiples are ratios of a stock’s price to some measure of value per share. Price multiples are most frequently applied to valuation in the method of comparables. This method involves using a price multiple to evaluate whether an asset is relatively undervalued, fairly valued, or overvalued in relation to a benchmark value of the multiple. The benchmark value of the multiple may be the multiple of a similar company or the median or average value of the multiple for a peer group of companies, an industry, an economic sector, an equity index, or the company’s own median or average past values of the multiple. The economic rationale for the method of comparables is the law of one price. Price multiples may also be applied to valuation in the method based on forecasted fundamentals. Discounted cash flow (DCF) models provide the basis and rationale for this method. Fundamentals also interest analysts who use the method of comparables because differences between a price multiple and its benchmark value may be explained by differences in fundamentals. The key idea behind the use of price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) is that earning power is a chief driver of investment value and earnings per share (EPS) is probably the primary focus of security analysts’ attention. The EPS figure, however, is frequently subject to distortion, often volatile, and sometimes negative. The two alternative definitions of P/E are trailing P/E, based on the most recent four quarters of EPS, and forward P/E, based on next year’s expected earnings. Analysts address the problem of cyclicality by normalizing EPS—that is, calculating the level of EPS that the business could achieve currently under mid-cyclical conditions (normalized EPS). Two methods to normalize EPS are the method of historical average EPS (calculated over the most recent full cycle) and the method of average return on equity (EPS = average ROE multiplied by current book value per share). Earnings yield (E/P) is the reciprocal of the P/E. When stocks have zero or negative EPS, a ranking by earnings yield is meaningful whereas a ranking by P/E is not. Historical trailing P/Es should be calculated with EPS lagged a sufficient amount of time to avoid look-ahead bias. The same principle applies to other multiples calculated on a trailing basis. The fundamental drivers of P/E are the expected earnings growth rate and the required rate of return. The justified P/E based on fundamentals bears a positive relationship to the first factor and an inverse relationship to the second factor. The PEG (P/E-to-growth) ratio is a tool to incorporate the impact of earnings growth on P/E. The PEG ratio is calculated as the ratio of the P/E to the consensus growth forecast. Stocks with low PEG ratios are, all else equal, more attractive than stocks with high PEG ratios. We can estimate terminal value in multistage DCF models by using price multiples based on comparables. The expression for terminal value, V n , is (using P/E as the example) V n = Benchmark value of trailing P/E × E n or V n = Benchmark value of forward P/E × E n +1 . Book value per share is intended to represent, on a per-share basis, the investment that common shareholders have in the company. Inflation, technological change, and accounting distortions, however, may impair the use of book value for this purpose. Book value is calculated as common shareholders’ equity divided by the number of shares outstanding. Analysts adjust book value to accurately reflect the value of the shareholders’ investment and to make P/B (the price-to-book ratio) more useful for comparing different stocks. The fundamental drivers of P/B are ROE and the required rate of return. The justified P/B based on fundamentals bears a positive relationship to the first factor and an inverse relationship to the second factor. An important rationale for using the price-to-sales ratio (P/S) is that sales, as the top line in an income statement, are generally less subject to distortion or manipulation than other fundamentals, such as EPS or book value. Sales are also more stable than earnings and are never negative. P/S fails to take into account differences in cost structure between businesses, may not properly reflect the situation of companies losing money, and may be subject to manipulation through revenue recognition practices. The fundamental drivers of P/S are profit margin, growth rate, and the required rate of return. The justified P/S based on fundamentals bears a positive relationship to the first two factors and an inverse relationship to the third factor. Enterprise value (EV) is total company value (the market value of debt, common equity, and preferred equity) minus the value of cash and investments. The ratio of EV to total sales is conceptually preferable to P/S because EV/S facilitates comparisons among companies with varying capital structures. A key idea behind the use of price to cash flow is that cash flow is less subject to manipulation than are earnings. Price-to-cash-flow multiples are often more stable than P/Es. Some common approximations to cash flow from operations have limitations, however, because they ignore items that may be subject to manipulation. The major cash flow (and related) concepts used in multiples are earnings plus noncash charges (CF), cash flow from operations (CFO), free cash flow to equity (FCFE), and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). In calculating price to cash flow, the earnings-plus-noncash-charges concept is traditionally used, although FCFE has the strongest link to financial theory. CF and EBITDA are not strictly cash flow numbers because they do not account for noncash revenue and net changes in working capital. The fundamental drivers of price to cash flow, however defined, are the expected growth rate of future cash flow and the required rate of return. The justified price to cash flow based on fundamentals bears a positive relationship to the first factor and an inverse relationship to the second. EV/EBITDA is preferred to P/EBITDA because EBITDA, as a pre-interest number, is a flow to all providers of capital. EV/EBITDA may be more appropriate than P/E for comparing companies with different amounts of financial leverage (debt). EV/EBITDA is frequently used in the valuation of capital-intensive businesses. The fundamental drivers of EV/EBITDA are the expected growth rate in free cash flow to the firm, profitability, and the weighted average cost of capital. The justified EV/EBITDA based on fundamentals bears a positive relationship to the first two factors and an inverse relationship to the third. Dividend yield has been used as a valuation indicator because it is a component of total return and is less risky than capital appreciation. Trailing dividend yield is calculated as four times the most recent quarterly per-share dividend divided by the current market price. The fundamental drivers of dividend yield are the expected growth rate in dividends and the required rate of return. Comparing companies across borders frequently involves dealing with differences in accounting standards, cultural differences, economic differences, and resulting differences in risk and growth opportunities. Momentum indicators relate either price or a fundamental to the time series of the price’s or fundamental’s own past values (in some cases, to their expected values). Momentum valuation indicators include earnings surprise, standardized unexpected earnings (SUE), and relative strength. Unexpected earnings (or earnings surprise) equals the difference between reported earnings and expected earnings. SUE is unexpected earnings divided by the standard deviation in past unexpected earnings. Relative-strength indicators allow comparison of a stock’s performance during a period either with its own past performance (first type) or with the performance of some group of stocks (second type). The rationale for using relative strength is the thesis that patterns of persistence or reversal in returns exist. Screening is the application of a set of criteria to reduce an investment universe to a smaller set of investments and is a part of many stock selection disciplines. In general, limitations of such screens include the lack of control in vendor-provided data of the calculation of important inputs and the absence of qualitative factors.

The answers to this question usually influence success or failure in achieving investment objectives. For one group of those participants—equity analysts—the question and its potential answers are particularly critical because determining the value of an ownership stake is at the heart of their professional activities and decisions. Valuation is the estimation of an asset’s value based on variables perceived to be related to future investment returns, on comparisons with similar assets, or, when relevant, on estimates of immediate liquidation proceeds. Skill in valuation is a very important element of success in investing. We address some basic questions: What is value? Who uses equity valuations? What is the importance of industry knowledge? How can the analyst effectively communicate his analysis? We answer these and other questions and lay a foundation for the topics that follow. The following section defines value and describes the various uses of equity valuation. The subsequent sections examine the steps in the valuation process, including the analyst’s role and responsibilities, and discuss how valuation results are communicated. They also provide some guidance on the content and format of an effective research report.",The member should be able to: define valuation and intrinsic value and explain sources of perceived mispricing; explain the going concern assumption and contrast a going concern value to a liquidation value; describe definitions of value and justify which definition of value is most relevant to public company valuation; describe applications of equity valuation; describe questions that should be addressed in conducting an industry and competitive analysis; contrast absolute and relative valuation models and describe examples of each type of model; describe sum-of-the-parts valuation and conglomerate discounts; explain broad criteria for choosing an appropriate approach for valuing a given company.,"In this reading, we have discussed the scope of equity valuation, outlined the valuation process, introduced valuation concepts and models, discussed the analyst’s role and responsibilities in conducting valuation, and described the elements of an effective research report in which analysts communicate their valuation analysis. Valuation is the estimation of an asset’s value based on either variables perceived to be related to future investment returns or comparisons with closely similar assets. The intrinsic value of an asset is its value given a hypothetically complete understanding of the asset’s investment characteristics. The assumption that the market price of a security can diverge from its intrinsic value—as suggested by the rational efficient markets formulation of efficient market theory—underpins active investing. Intrinsic value incorporates the going-concern assumption, that is, the assumption that a company will continue operating for the foreseeable future. In contrast, liquidation value is the company’s value if it were dissolved and its assets sold individually. Fair value is the price at which an asset (or liability) would change hands if neither buyer nor seller were under compulsion to buy/sell and both were informed about material underlying facts. In addition to stock selection by active traders, valuation is also used for: inferring (extracting) market expectations; evaluating corporate events; issuing fairness opinions; evaluating business strategies and models; and appraising private businesses. The valuation process has five steps: Understanding the business. Forecasting company performance. Selecting the appropriate valuation model. Converting forecasts to a valuation. Applying the analytical results in the form of recommendations and conclusions. Understanding the business includes evaluating industry prospects, competitive position, and corporate strategies—all of which contribute to making more accurate forecasts. Understanding the business also involves analysis of financial reports, including evaluating the quality of a company’s earnings. In forecasting company performance, a top-down forecasting approach moves from macroeconomic forecasts to industry forecasts and then to individual company and asset forecasts. A bottom-up forecasting approach aggregates individual company forecasts to industry forecasts, which in turn may be aggregated to macroeconomic forecasts. Selecting the appropriate valuation approach means choosing an approach that is: consistent with the characteristics of the company being valued; appropriate given the availability and quality of the data; and consistent with the analyst’s valuation purpose and perspective. Two broad categories of valuation models are absolute valuation models and relative valuation models. Absolute valuation models specify an asset’s intrinsic value, supplying a point estimate of value that can be compared with market price. Present value models of common stock (also called discounted cash flow models) are the most important type of absolute valuation model. Relative valuation models specify an asset’s value relative to the value of another asset. As applied to equity valuation, relative valuation is also known as the method of comparables, which involves comparison of a stock’s price multiple to a benchmark price multiple. The benchmark price multiple can be based on a similar stock or on the average price multiple of some group of stocks. Two important aspects of converting forecasts to valuation are sensitivity analysis and situational adjustments. Sensitivity analysis is an analysis to determine how changes in an assumed input would affect the outcome of an analysis. Situational adjustments include control premiums (premiums for a controlling interest in the company), discounts for lack of marketability (discounts reflecting the lack of a public market for the company’s shares), and illiquidity discounts (discounts reflecting the lack of a liquid market for the company’s shares). Applying valuation conclusions depends on the purpose of the valuation. In performing valuations, analysts must hold themselves accountable to both standards of competence and standards of conduct. An effective research report: contains timely information; is written in clear, incisive language; is objective and well researched, with key assumptions clearly identified; distinguishes clearly between facts and opinions; contains analysis, forecasts, valuation, and a recommendation that are internally consistent; presents sufficient information that the reader can critique the valuation; states the risk factors for an investment in the company; and discloses any potential conflicts of interest faced by the analyst. Analysts have an obligation to provide substantive and meaningful content. CFA Institute members have an additional overriding responsibility to adhere to the CFA Institute Code of Ethics and relevant specific Standards of Professional Conduct.

An analyst or investor who can recognize high-quality financial reporting can have greater confidence in analysis based on those financial reports and the resulting investment decisions. Similarly, an analyst or investor who can recognize poor financial reporting quality early—before deficiencies become widely known—is more likely to make profitable investment decisions or to reduce or even avoid losses. An example of early recognition of an ultimate financial disaster is James Chanos’s short position in Enron in November 2000 —more than a year before Enron filed for bankruptcy protection (in December 2001). Despite Enron’s high profile and reputation, Chanos had a negative view of Enron based on both quantitative and qualitative factors. Chanos noted that Enron’s return on capital was both lower than comparable companies’ return on capital and lower than the company’s own cost of capital. Qualitative factors contributing to Chanos’s view included the company’s aggressive revenue recognition policy, its complex and difficult-to-understand disclosures on related-party transactions, and one-time earnings-boosting gains. Later events that substantiated Chanos’s perspective included sales of the company’s stock by insiders and the resignation of senior executives. Another example of early recognition of eventual financial troubles is June 2001 reports by analyst Enitan Adebonojo. These reports highlighted questionable accounting by Royal Ahold, a European food retailer. The questionable accounting included “claiming profits of acquired firms as ‘organic growth,’ booking capital gains from sale-and-leaseback deals as profit, and keeping billions in debt off its balance sheet.” In 2003, Royal Ahold announced that it had significantly overstated its profits in the prior two years. The CEO and CFO resigned, various regulators announced investigations, and Royal Ahold’s market value dropped significantly. This reading focuses on reporting quality and the interrelated attribute of results quality. Reporting quality pertains to the information disclosed in financial reports. High-quality reporting provides decision-useful information—information that is relevant and faithfully represents the economic reality of the company’s activities during the reporting period and the company’s financial condition at the end of the period. A separate, but interrelated, attribute of quality is results or earnings quality , which pertains to the earnings and cash generated by the company’s actual economic activities and the resulting financial condition relative to expectations of current and future financial performance. Note that the term “earnings quality” is more commonly used in practice than “results quality,” so throughout this reading, earnings quality is used broadly to encompass the quality of earnings, cash flow, and/or balance sheet items. High-quality earnings reflect an adequate level of return on investment and are derived from activities that a company will likely be able to sustain in the future. Thus, high-quality earnings increase the value of a company more than low-quality earnings. When reported earnings are described as being high quality, it means that the company’s underlying economic performance was good (i.e., value enhancing), and it also implies that the company had high reporting quality (i.e., that the information that the company calculated and disclosed was a good reflection of the economic reality). Earnings can be termed “low quality” either because the reported information properly represents genuinely bad performance or because the reported information misrepresents economic reality. In theory, a company could have low-quality earnings while simultaneously having high reporting quality. Consider a company with low-quality earnings—for example, one whose only source of earnings in a period is a one-off settlement of a lawsuit without which the company would have reported huge losses. The company could nonetheless have high reporting quality if it calculated its results properly and provided decision-useful information. Although it is theoretically possible that a company could have low-quality earnings while simultaneously having high reporting quality, experiencing poor financial performance can motivate the company’s management to misreport. This reading begins in Section 2 with a description of a conceptual framework for and potential problems with financial reporting quality. This is followed in Section 3 with a discussion of how to evaluate financial reporting quality. Sections 4, 5, and 6 focus on the quality of reported earnings, cash flows, and balance sheets, respectively. Section 7 covers sources of information about risk. A summary and practice problems in the CFA Institute item set format complete the reading.",The member should be able to: demonstrate the use of a conceptual framework for assessing the quality of a company’s financial reports; explain potential problems that affect the quality of financial reports; describe how to evaluate the quality of a company’s financial reports; evaluate the quality of a company’s financial reports; describe the concept of sustainable (persistent) earnings; describe indicators of earnings quality; explain mean reversion in earnings and how the accruals component of earnings affects the speed of mean reversion; evaluate the earnings quality of a company; describe indicators of cash flow quality; evaluate the cash flow quality of a company; describe indicators of balance sheet quality; evaluate the balance sheet quality of a company; describe sources of information about risk.,Summary section is missing.,"['Ethics & Integrity', 'Financial Regulation', 'Financial Reporting & Accounting']",Evaluating Quality of Financial Reports,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/evaluating-quality-financial-reports

Equity prices reflect expectations of the future stream of earnings, which depend on expectations of future economic activity. This dynamic means that in the long term, the same factors that drive economic growth will be reflected in equity values. Similarly, the expected long-run growth rate of real income is a key determinant of the average real interest rate level in the economy, and therefore the level of real returns in general. In the shorter term, the relationship between actual and potential growth (i.e., the degree of slack in the economy) is a key driver of fixed-income returns. Therefore, in order to develop global portfolio strategies and investment return expectations, investors must be able to identify and forecast the factors that drive long-term sustainable growth trends. Based on a country’s long-term economic outlook, investors can then evaluate the long-term investment potential and risk of investing in the securities of companies located or operating in that country. In contrast to the short-run fluctuations of the business cycle, the study of economic growth focuses on the long-run trend in aggregate output as measured by potential GDP. Over long periods, the actual growth rate of GDP should equal the rate of increase in potential GDP because, by definition, output in excess of potential GDP requires employing labor and capital beyond their optimum levels. Thus, the growth rate of potential GDP acts as an upper limit to growth and determines the economy’s sustainable rate of growth. Increasing the growth rate of potential GDP is the key to raising the level of income, the level of profits, and the living standard of the population. Even small differences in the growth rate translate into large differences in the level of income over time. What drives long-run growth? What distinguishes the “winners” from the “losers” in the long-run growth arena? Will poor countries catch up with rich countries over time? Can policies have a permanent effect on the sustainable growth rate? If so, how? If not, why not? These and other key questions are addressed in detail in this reading. We first examine the long-term growth record, focusing on the extent of growth variation across countries and across decades. We then discuss the importance of economic growth to global investors and examine the relationship between investment returns and economic growth. We next turn to the factors that determine long-run economic growth before presenting the classical, neoclassical, and endogenous growth models. We also discuss whether poorer countries are converging to the higher income levels of the richer countries. Finally, we look at the impact of international trade on economic growth.","The member should be able to: compare factors favoring and limiting economic growth in developed and developing economies; describe the relation between the long-run rate of stock market appreciation and the sustainable growth rate of the economy; explain why potential GDP and its growth rate matter for equity and fixed income investors; distinguish between capital deepening investment and technological progress and explain how each affects economic growth and labor productivity; forecast potential GDP based on growth accounting relations; explain how natural resources affect economic growth and evaluate the argument that limited availability of natural resources constrains economic growth; explain how demographics, immigration, and labor force participation affect the rate and sustainability of economic growth; explain how investment in physical capital, human capital, and technological development affects economic growth; compare classical growth theory, neoclassical growth theory, and endogenous growth theory; explain and evaluate convergence hypotheses; describe the economic rationale for governments to provide incentives to private investment in technology and knowledge; describe the expected impact of removing trade barriers on capital investment and profits, employment and wages, and growth in the economies involved.","This reading focuses on the factors that determine the long-term growth trend in the economy. As part of the development of global portfolio equity and fixed-income strategies, investors must be able to determine both the near-term and the sustainable rates of growth within a country. Doing so requires identifying and forecasting the factors that determine the level of GDP and that determine long-term sustainable trends in economic growth. The sustainable rate of economic growth is measured by the rate of increase in the economy’s productive capacity or potential GDP. Growth in real GDP measures how rapidly the total economy is expanding. Per capita GDP, defined as real GDP divided by population, measures the standard of living in each country. The growth rate of real GDP and the level of per capita real GDP vary widely among countries. As a result, investment opportunities differ by country. Equity markets respond to anticipated growth in earnings. Higher sustainable economic growth should lead to higher earnings growth and equity market valuation ratios, all other things being equal. The best estimate for the long-term growth in earnings for a given country is the estimate of the growth rate in potential GDP. In the long run, the growth rate of earnings cannot exceed the growth in potential GDP. Labor productivity is critical because it affects the level of the upper limit. A permanent increase in productivity growth will raise the upper limit on earnings growth and should translate into faster long-run earnings growth and a corresponding increase in stock price appreciation. For global fixed-income investors, a critical macroeconomic variable is the rate of inflation. One of the best indicators of short- to intermediate-term inflation trends is the difference between the growth rate of actual and potential GDP. Capital deepening, an increase in the capital-to-labor ratio, occurs when the growth rate of capital (net investment) exceeds the growth rate of labor. In a graph of output per capita versus the capital-to-labor ratio, it is reflected by a move along the curve (i.e., the production function). An increase in total factor productivity causes a proportional upward shift in the entire production function. One method of measuring sustainable growth uses the production function and the growth accounting framework developed by Solow. It arrives at the growth rate of potential GDP by estimating the growth rates of the economy’s capital and labor inputs plus an estimate of total factor productivity. An alternative method measures potential growth as the long-term growth rate of the labor force plus the long-term growth rate of labor productivity. The forces driving economic growth include the quantity and quality of labor and the supply of non-ICT and ICT capital, public capital, raw materials, and technological knowledge. The labor supply is determined by population growth, the labor force participation rate, and net immigration. The physical capital stock in a country increases with net investment. The correlation between long-run economic growth and the rate of investment is high. Technological advances are discoveries that make it possible to produce more or higher-quality goods and services with the same resources or inputs. Technology is a major factor determining TFP. TFP is the main factor affecting long-term, sustainable economic growth rates in developed countries and also includes the cumulative effects of scientific advances, applied research and development, improvements in management methods, and ways of organizing production that raise the productive capacity of factories and offices. Total factor productivity, estimated using a growth accounting equation, is the residual component of growth after accounting for the weighted contributions of all explicit factors (e.g., labor and capital). Labor productivity is defined as output per worker or per hour worked. Growth in labor productivity depends on capital deepening and technological progress. The academic growth literature is divided into three theories —the classical view, the neoclassical model, and the new endogenous growth view. In the classical model, growth in per capita income is only temporary because an exploding population with limited resources brings per capita income growth to an end. In the neoclassical model, a sustained increase in investment increases the economy’s growth rate only in the short run. Capital is subject to diminishing marginal returns, so long-run growth depends solely on population growth, progress in TFP, and labor’s share of income. The neoclassical model assumes that the production function exhibits diminishing marginal productivity with respect to any individual input. The point at which capital per worker and output per worker are growing at equal, sustainable rates is called the steady state or balanced growth path for the economy. In the steady state, total output grows at the rate of labor force growth plus the rate of growth of TFP divided by the elasticity of output with respect to labor input. The following parameters affect the steady-state values for the capital-to-labor ratio and output per worker: saving rate, labor force growth, growth in TFP, depreciation rate, and elasticity of output with respect to capital. The main criticism of the neoclassical model is that it provides no quantifiable prediction of the rate or form of TFP change. TFP progress is regarded as exogenous to the model. Endogenous growth theory explains technological progress within the model rather than treating it as exogenous. As a result, self-sustaining growth emerges as a natural consequence of the model and the economy does not converge to a steady-state rate of growth that is independent of saving/investment decisions. Unlike the neoclassical model, where increasing capital will result in diminishing marginal returns, the endogenous growth model allows for the possibility of constant or even increasing returns to capital in the aggregate economy. In the endogenous growth model, expenditures made on R&D and for human capital may have large positive externalities or spillover effects. Private spending by companies on knowledge capital generates benefits to the economy as a whole that exceed the private benefit to the company. The convergence hypothesis predicts that the rates of growth of productivity and GDP should be higher in the developing countries. Those higher growth rates imply that the per capita GDP gap between developing and developed economies should narrow over time. The evidence on convergence is mixed. Countries fail to converge because of low rates of investment and savings, lack of property rights, political instability, poor education and health, restrictions on trade, and tax and regulatory policies that discourage work and investing. Opening an economy to financial and trade flows has a major impact on economic growth. The evidence suggests that more open and trade-oriented economies will grow at a faster rate.

The amount of worldwide merchandise exports in 2010 was more than twice the amount in 2003 (US$7.4 trillion) and more than four times the amount in 1993 (US$3.7 trillion). The top five exporting countries in 2010, in order, were China, the United States, Germany, Japan, and the Netherlands. In the United States alone, 293,131 companies were identified as exporters in 2010, but only 2.2% of those companies were large (more than 500 employees). The vast majority of US companies with export activity were small or medium-sized entities. The point illustrated by these statistics is that many companies engage in transactions that cross national borders. The parties to these transactions must agree on the currency in which to settle the transaction. Generally, this will be the currency of either the buyer or the seller. Exporters that receive payment in foreign currency and allow the purchaser time to pay must carry a foreign currency receivable on their books. Conversely, importers that agree to pay in foreign currency will have a foreign currency account payable. To be able to include them in the total amount of accounts receivable (payable) reported on the balance sheet, these foreign currency denominated accounts receivable (payable) must be translated into the currency in which the exporter (importer) keeps its books and presents financial statements. The prices at which foreign currencies can be purchased or sold are called foreign exchange rates. Because foreign exchange rates fluctuate over time, the value of foreign currency payables and receivables also fluctuates. The major accounting issue related to foreign currency transactions is how to reflect the changes in value for foreign currency payables and receivables in the financial statements. Many companies have operations located in foreign countries. For example, the Swiss food products company Nestlé SA reports that it has factories in 83 countries and a presence in almost every country in the world. US-based Procter & Gamble’s annual filing discloses more than 400 subsidiaries located in more than 80 countries around the world. Foreign subsidiaries are generally required to keep accounting records in the currency of the country in which they are located. To prepare consolidated financial statements, the parent company must translate the foreign currency financial statements of its foreign subsidiaries into its own currency. Nestlé, for example, must translate the assets and liabilities its various foreign subsidiaries carry in foreign currency into Swiss francs to be able to consolidate those amounts with the Swiss franc assets and liabilities located in Switzerland. A multinational company like Nestlé is likely to have two types of foreign currency activities that require special accounting treatment. Most multinationals (1) engage in transactions that are denominated in a foreign currency and (2) invest in foreign subsidiaries that keep their books in a foreign currency. To prepare consolidated financial statements, a multinational company must translate the foreign currency amounts related to both types of international activities into the currency in which the company presents its financial statements. This reading presents the accounting for foreign currency transactions and the translation of foreign currency financial statements. The conceptual issues related to these accounting topics are discussed, and the specific rules embodied in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and US GAAP are demonstrated through examples. Fortunately, differences between IFRS and US GAAP with respect to foreign currency translation issues are minimal. Analysts need to understand the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the financial statements of a multinational company and how a company’s financial statements reflect foreign currency gains and losses, whether realized or not.","The member should be able to: distinguish among presentation (reporting) currency, functional currency, and local currency; describe foreign currency transaction exposure, including accounting for and disclosures about foreign currency transaction gains and losses; analyze how changes in exchange rates affect the translated sales of the subsidiary and parent company; compare the current rate method and the temporal method, evaluate how each affects the parent company’s balance sheet and income statement, and determine which method is appropriate in various scenarios; calculate the translation effects and evaluate the translation of a subsidiary’s balance sheet and income statement into the parent company’s presentation currency; analyze how the current rate method and the temporal method affect financial statements and ratios; analyze how alternative translation methods for subsidiaries operating in hyperinflationary economies affect financial statements and ratios; describe how multinational operations affect a company’s effective tax rate; explain how changes in the components of sales affect the sustainability of sales growth; analyze how currency fluctuations potentially affect financial results, given a company’s countries of operation.","The translation of foreign currency amounts is an important accounting issue for companies with multinational operations. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations cause the functional currency values of foreign currency assets and liabilities resulting from foreign currency transactions as well as from foreign subsidiaries to change over time. These changes in value give rise to foreign exchange differences that companies’ financial statements must reflect. Determining how to measure these foreign exchange differences and whether to include them in the calculation of net income are the major issues in accounting for multinational operations. The local currency is the national currency of the country where an entity is located. The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates. Normally, the local currency is an entity’s functional currency. For accounting purposes, any currency other than an entity’s functional currency is a foreign currency for that entity. The currency in which financial statement amounts are presented is known as the presentation currency. In most cases, the presentation currency will be the same as the local currency. When an export sale (import purchase) on an account is denominated in a foreign currency, the sales revenue (inventory) and foreign currency account receivable (account payable) are translated into the seller’s (buyer’s) functional currency using the exchange rate on the transaction date. Any change in the functional currency value of the foreign currency account receivable (account payable) that occurs between the transaction date and the settlement date is recognized as a foreign currency transaction gain or loss in net income. If a balance sheet date falls between the transaction date and the settlement date, the foreign currency account receivable (account payable) is translated at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. The change in the functional currency value of the foreign currency account receivable (account payable) is recognized as a foreign currency transaction gain or loss in income. Analysts should understand that these gains and losses are unrealized at the time they are recognized and might or might not be realized when the transactions are settled. A foreign currency transaction gain arises when an entity has a foreign currency receivable and the foreign currency strengthens or it has a foreign currency payable and the foreign currency weakens. A foreign currency transaction loss arises when an entity has a foreign currency receivable and the foreign currency weakens or it has a foreign currency payable and the foreign currency strengthens. Companies must disclose the net foreign currency gain or loss included in income. They may choose to report foreign currency transaction gains and losses as a component of operating income or as a component of non-operating income. If two companies choose to report foreign currency transaction gains and losses differently, operating profit and operating profit margin might not be directly comparable between the two companies. To prepare consolidated financial statements, foreign currency financial statements of foreign operations must be translated into the parent company’s presentation currency. The major conceptual issues related to this translation process are, What is the appropriate exchange rate for translating each financial statement item, and how should the resulting translation adjustment be reflected in the consolidated financial statements? Two different translation methods are used worldwide. Under the current rate method, assets and liabilities are translated at the current exchange rate, equity items are translated at historical exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at the exchange rate that existed when the underlying transaction occurred. For practical reasons, an average exchange rate is often used to translate income items. Under the temporal method, monetary assets (and non-monetary assets measured at current value) and monetary liabilities (and non-monetary liabilities measured at current value) are translated at the current exchange rate. Non-monetary assets and liabilities not measured at current value and equity items are translated at historical exchange rates. Revenues and expenses, other than those expenses related to non-monetary assets, are translated at the exchange rate that existed when the underlying transaction occurred. Expenses related to non-monetary assets are translated at the exchange rates used for the related assets. Under both IFRS and US GAAP, the functional currency of a foreign operation determines the method to be used in translating its foreign currency financial statements into the parent’s presentation currency and whether the resulting translation adjustment is recognized in income or as a separate component of equity. The foreign currency financial statements of a foreign operation that has a foreign currency as its functional currency are translated using the current rate method, and the translation adjustment is accumulated as a separate component of equity. The cumulative translation adjustment related to a specific foreign entity is transferred to net income when that entity is sold or otherwise disposed of. The balance sheet risk exposure associated with the current rate method is equal to the foreign subsidiary’s net asset position. The foreign currency financial statements of a foreign operation that has the parent’s presentation currency as its functional currency are translated using the temporal method, and the translation adjustment is included as a gain or loss in income. US GAAP refer to this process as remeasurement. The balance sheet exposure associated with the temporal method is equal to the foreign subsidiary’s net monetary asset/liability position (adjusted for non-monetary items measured at current value). IFRS and US GAAP differ with respect to the translation of foreign currency financial statements of foreign operations located in a highly inflationary country. Under IFRS, the foreign currency statements are first restated for local inflation and then translated using the current exchange rate. Under US GAAP, the foreign currency financial statements are translated using the temporal method, with no restatement for inflation. Applying different translation methods for a given foreign operation can result in very different amounts reported in the parent’s consolidated financial statements. Companies must disclose the total amount of translation gain or loss reported in income and the amount of translation adjustment included in a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Companies are not required to separately disclose the component of translation gain or loss arising from foreign currency transactions and the component arising from application of the temporal method. Disclosures related to translation adjustments reported in equity can be used to include these as gains and losses in determining an adjusted amount of income following a clean-surplus approach to income measurement. Foreign currency translation rules are well established in both IFRS and US GAAP. Fortunately, except for the treatment of foreign operations located in highly inflationary countries, the two sets of standards have no major differences in this area. The ability to understand the impact of foreign currency translation on the financial results of a company using IFRS should apply equally well in the analysis of financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP. An analyst can obtain information about the tax impact of multinational operations from companies’ disclosure on effective tax rates. For a multinational company, sales growth is driven not only by changes in volume and price but also by changes in the exchange rates between the reporting currency and the currency in which sales are made. Arguably, growth in sales that comes from changes in volume or price is more sustainable than growth in sales that comes from changes in exchange rates.

Companies invest in the debt and equity securities of other companies to diversify their asset base, enter new markets, obtain competitive advantages, deploy excess cash, and achieve additional profitability. Debt securities include commercial paper, corporate and government bonds and notes, redeemable preferred stock, and asset-backed securities. Equity securities include common stock and non-redeemable preferred stock. The percentage of equity ownership a company acquires in an investee depends on the resources available, the ability to acquire the shares, and the desired level of influence or control. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) worked to reduce differences in accounting standards that apply to the classification, measurement, and disclosure of intercorporate investments. The resulting standards have improved the relevance, transparency, and comparability of information provided in financial statements. Complete convergence between IFRS accounting standards and US GAAP did not occur for accounting for financial instruments, and some differences still exist. The terminology used in this reading is IFRS-oriented. US GAAP may not use identical terminology, but in most cases the terminology is similar. This reading is organized as follows: Section 2 explains the basic categorization of corporate investments. Section 3 describes reporting under IFRS 9, the IASB standard for financial instruments. Section 4 describes equity method reporting for investments in associates where significant influence can exist including the reporting for joint ventures, a type of investment where control is shared. Section 5 describes reporting for business combinations, the parent/subsidiary relationship, and variable interest and special purpose entities. A summary concludes the reading.","The member should be able to: describe the classification, measurement, and disclosure under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for 1) investments in financial assets, 2) investments in associates, 3) joint ventures, 4) business combinations, and 5) special purpose and variable interest entities; distinguish between IFRS and US GAAP in the classification, measurement, and disclosure of investments in financial assets, investments in associates, joint ventures, business combinations, and special purpose and variable interest entities; analyze how different methods used to account for intercorporate investments affect financial statements and ratios.","Intercompany investments play a significant role in business activities and create significant challenges for the analyst in assessing company performance. Investments in other companies can take five basic forms: investments in financial assets, investments in associates, joint ventures, business combinations, and investments in special purpose and variable interest entities. Key concepts are as follows: Investments in financial assets are those in which the investor has no significant influence. They can be measured and reported as Fair value through profit or loss. Fair value through other comprehensive income. Amortized cost. IFRS and US GAAP treat investments in financial assets in a similar manner. Investments in associates and joint ventures are those in which the investor has significant influence, but not control, over the investee’s business activities. Because the investor can exert significant influence over financial and operating policy decisions, IFRS and US GAAP require the equity method of accounting because it provides a more objective basis for reporting investment income. The equity method requires the investor to recognize income as earned rather than when dividends are received. The equity investment is carried at cost, plus its share of post-acquisition income (after adjustments) less dividends received. The equity investment is reported as a single line item on the balance sheet and on the income statement. IFRS and US GAAP accounting standards require the use of the acquisition method to account for business combinations. Fair value of the consideration given is the appropriate measurement for identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in the business combination. Goodwill is the difference between the acquisition value and the fair value of the target’s identifiable net tangible and intangible assets. Because it is considered to have an indefinite life, it is not amortized. Instead, it is evaluated at least annually for impairment. Impairment losses are reported on the income statement. IFRS use a one-step approach to determine and measure the impairment loss, whereas US GAAP uses a two-step approach. If the acquiring company acquires less than 100%, non-controlling (minority) shareholders’ interests are reported on the consolidated financial statements. IFRS allows the non-controlling interest to be measured at either its fair value (full goodwill) or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets (partial goodwill). US GAAP requires the non-controlling interest to be measured at fair value (full goodwill). Consolidated financial statements are prepared in each reporting period. Special purpose (SPEs) and variable interest entities (VIEs) are required to be consolidated by the entity which is expected to absorb the majority of the expected losses or receive the majority of expected residual benefits.

Retirement benefits include pensions and other post-employment benefits, such as health insurance. Examples of share-based compensation are stock options and stock grants. A common issue underlying both of these aspects of employee compensation is the difficulty in measuring the value of the compensation. One factor contributing to the difficulty is that employees earn the benefits in the periods that they provide service but typically receive the benefits in future periods, so measurement requires a significant number of assumptions. This reading provides an overview of the methods companies use to estimate and measure the benefits they provide to their employees and how this information is reported in financial statements. There has been some convergence between International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and US generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP) in the measurement and accounting treatment for pensions, other post-employment benefits, and share-based compensation, but some differences remain. Although this reading focuses on IFRS as the basis for discussion, instances where US GAAP significantly differ are discussed. The reading is organized as follows: Section 2 addresses pensions and other post-employment benefits, and Section 3 covers share-based compensation with a primary focus on the accounting for and analysis of stock options. A summary and practice problems conclude the reading.","The member should be able to: describe the types of post-employment benefit plans and implications for financial reports; explain and calculate measures of a defined benefit pension obligation (i.e., present value of the defined benefit obligation and projected benefit obligation) and net pension liability (or asset); describe the components of a company’s defined benefit pension costs; explain and calculate the effect of a defined benefit plan’s assumptions on the defined benefit obligation and periodic pension cost; explain and calculate how adjusting for items of pension and other post-employment benefits that are reported in the notes to the financial statements affects financial statements and ratios; interpret pension plan note disclosures including cash flow related information; explain issues associated with accounting for share-based compensation; explain how accounting for stock grants and stock options affects financial statements, and the importance of companies’ assumptions in valuing these grants and options.","This reading discussed two different forms of employee compensation: post-employment benefits and share-based compensation. Although different, the two are similar in that they are forms of compensation outside of the standard salary arrangements. They also involve complex valuation, accounting, and reporting issues. Although IFRS and US GAAP are converging on accounting and reporting, it is important to note that differences in a country’s social system, laws, and regulations can result in differences in a company’s pension and share-based compensation plans that may be reflected in the company’s earnings and financial reports. Key points include the following: Defined contribution pension plans specify (define) only the amount of contribution to the plan; the eventual amount of the pension benefit to the employee will depend on the value of an employee’s plan assets at the time of retirement. Balance sheet reporting is less analytically relevant for defined contribution plans because companies make contributions to defined contribution plans as the expense arises and thus no liabilities accrue for that type of plan. Defined benefit pension plans specify (define) the amount of the pension benefit, often determined by a plan formula, under which the eventual amount of the benefit to the employee is a function of length of service and final salary. Defined benefit pension plan obligations are funded by the sponsoring company contributing assets to a pension trust, a separate legal entity. Differences exist in countries’ regulatory requirements for companies to fund defined benefit pension plan obligations. Both IFRS and US GAAP require companies to report on their balance sheet a pension liability or asset equal to the projected benefit obligation minus the fair value of plan assets. The amount of a pension asset that can be reported is subject to a ceiling. Under IFRS, the components of periodic pension cost are recognised as follows: Service cost is recognised in P&L, net interest income/expense is recognised in P&L, and remeasurements are recognised in OCI and are not amortised to future P&L. Under US GAAP, the components of periodic pension cost recognised in P&L include current service costs, interest expense on the pension obligation, and expected returns on plan assets (which reduces the cost). Other components of periodic pension cost—including past service costs, actuarial gains and losses, and differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets—are recognised in OCI and amortised to future P&L. Estimates of the future obligation under defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefits are sensitive to numerous assumptions, including discount rates, assumed annual compensation increases, expected return on plan assets, and assumed health care cost inflation. Employee compensation packages are structured to fulfill varied objectives, including satisfying employees’ needs for liquidity, retaining employees, and providing incentives to employees. Common components of employee compensation packages are salary, bonuses, and share-based compensation. Share-based compensation serves to align employees’ interests with those of the shareholders. It includes stocks and stock options. Share-based compensation has the advantage of requiring no current-period cash outlays. Share-based compensation expense is reported at fair value under IFRS and US GAAP. The valuation technique, or option pricing model, that a company uses is an important choice in determining fair value and is disclosed. Key assumptions and input into option pricing models include such items as exercise price, stock price volatility, estimated life of each award, estimated number of options that will be forfeited, dividend yield, and the risk-free rate of interest. Certain assumptions are highly subjective, such as stock price volatility or the expected life of stock options, and can greatly change the estimated fair value and thus compensation expense.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V3R6_discounted_dividend_valuation.pdf,Equity Investments,2024,Level II,"Common stock represents an ownership interest in a business. A business in its operations generates a stream of cash flows, and as owners of the business, common stockholders have an equity ownership claim on those future cash flows. Beginning with John Burr Williams (1938), analysts have developed this insight into a group of valuation models known as discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation models. DCF models—which view the intrinsic value of common stock as the present value of its expected future cash flows—are a fundamental tool in both investment management and investment research. Although the principles behind discounted cash flow valuation are simple, applying the theory to equity valuation can be challenging. Four broad steps in applying DCF analysis to equity valuation are: choosing the class of DCF model—equivalently, selecting a specific definition of cash flow; forecasting the cash flows; choosing a discount rate methodology; and estimating the discount rate. In our coverage of this topic, we take the perspective that dividends—distributions to shareholders authorized by a company’s board of directors—are an appropriate definition of cash flows. The class of models based on this idea is called dividend discount models, or DDMs. The basic objective of any DDM is to value a stock. The variety of implementations corresponds to different ways to model a company’s future stream of dividend payments. The steps of choosing a discount rate methodology and estimating the discount rate involve the same considerations for all DCF models, so they have been presented separately in an earlier discussion. The sections are organized as follows: We first provide an overview of present value models. We then provide a general statement of the dividend discount model. Forecasting dividends, individually and in detail, into the indefinite future is not generally practicable, so the dividend-forecasting problem is usually simplified. One approach is to assign dividends to a stylized growth pattern. In the subsequent section, we focus on the simplest pattern—dividends growing at a constant rate forever (the constant growth or “Gordon growth” model). We then explain that for some companies, it is more appropriate to view earnings and dividends as having multiple stages of growth. We present multistage dividend discount models along with spreadsheet modeling. We lay out the determinants of dividend growth rates in the last section and conclude with a summary.","The member should be able to: compare dividends, free cash flow, and residual income as inputs to discounted cash flow models and identify investment situations for which each measure is suitable; calculate and interpret the value of a common stock using the dividend discount model (DDM) for single and multiple holding periods; calculate the value of a common stock using the Gordon growth model and explain the model’s underlying assumptions; calculate the value of non-callable fixed-rate perpetual preferred stock; calculate and interpret the implied growth rate of dividends using the Gordon growth model and current stock price; calculate and interpret the present value of growth opportunities (PVGO) and the component of the leading price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) related to PVGO; calculate and interpret the justified leading and trailing P/Es using the Gordon growth model; describe strengths and limitations of the Gordon growth model and justify its selection to value a company’s common shares; explain the growth phase, transition phase, and maturity phase of a business; explain the assumptions and justify the selection of the two-stage DDM, the H-model, the three-stage DDM, or spreadsheet modeling to value a company’s common shares; describe terminal value and explain alternative approaches to determining the terminal value in a DDM; calculate and interpret the value of common shares using the two-stage DDM, the H-model, and the three-stage DDM; explain the use of spreadsheet modeling to forecast dividends and to value common shares; estimate a required return based on any DDM, including the Gordon growth model and the H-model; calculate and interpret the sustainable growth rate of a company and demonstrate the use of DuPont analysis to estimate a company’s sustainable growth rate; evaluate whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued by the market based on a DDM estimate of value.","We have provided an overview of DCF models of valuation, discussed the estimation of a stock’s required rate of return, and presented in detail the dividend discount model. In DCF models, the value of any asset is the present value of its (expected) future cash flows V 0 = ∑ t = 1 n CF t ( 1 + r ) t , where V 0 is the value of the asset as of t = 0 (today), CF t is the (expected) cash flow at time t , and r is the discount rate or required rate of return. For infinitely lived assets such as common stocks, n runs to infinity. Several alternative streams of expected cash flows can be used to value equities, including dividends, free cash flow, and residual income. A discounted dividend approach is most suitable for dividend-paying stocks in which the company has a discernible dividend policy that has an understandable relationship to the company’s profitability and the investor has a non-control (minority ownership) perspective. The free cash flow approach (FCFF or FCFE) might be appropriate when the company does not pay dividends, dividends differ substantially from FCFE, free cash flows align with profitability, or the investor takes a control (majority ownership) perspective. The residual income approach can be useful when the company does not pay dividends (as an alternative to a FCF approach) or free cash flow is negative. The DDM with a single holding period gives stock value as V 0 = D 1 ( 1 + r ) 1 + P 1 ( 1 + r ) 1 = D 1 + P 1 ( 1 + r ) 1 , where D 1 is the expected dividend at Time 1 and V 0 is the stock’s (expected) value at Time 0. Assuming that V 0 is equal to today’s market price, P 0 , the expected holding-period return is r = D 1 + P 1 P 0 − 1 = D 1 P 0 + P 1 − P 0 P 0 . The expression for the DDM for any given finite holding period n and the general expression for the DDM are, respectively, V 0 = ∑ t = 1 n D t ( 1 + r ) t + P n ( 1 + r ) n and V 0 = ∑ t = 1 ∞ D t ( 1 + r ) t . There are two main approaches to the problem of forecasting dividends. First, an analyst can assign the entire stream of expected future dividends to one of several stylized growth patterns. Second, an analyst can forecast a finite number of dividends individually up to a terminal point and value the remaining dividends either by assigning them to a stylized growth pattern or by forecasting share price as of the terminal point of the dividend forecasts. The Gordon growth model assumes that dividends grow at a constant rate g forever, so that D t = D t– 1 (1 + g ). The dividend stream in the Gordon growth model has a value of V 0 = D 0 ( 1 + g ) r − g , or V 0 = D 1 r − g where r > g . The value of non-callable fixed-rate perpetual preferred stock is V 0 = D / r , where D is the stock’s (constant) annual dividend. Assuming that price equals value, the Gordon growth model estimate of a stock’s expected rate of return is r = D 0 ( 1 + g ) P 0 + g = D 1 P 0 + g . Given an estimate of the next-period dividend and the stock’s required rate of return, the Gordon growth model can be used to estimate the dividend growth rate implied by the current market price (making a constant growth rate assumption). The present value of growth opportunities is the part of a stock’s total value, V 0 , that comes from profitable future growth opportunities in contrast to the value associated with assets already in place. The relationship is V 0 = E 1 / r + PVGO, where E 1 / r is defined as the no-growth value per share. The leading price-to-earnings ratio ( P 0 / E 1 ) and the trailing price-to-earnings ratio ( P 0 / E 0 ) can be expressed in terms of the Gordon growth model as, respectively, P 0 E 1 = D 1 / E 1 r − g = 1 − b r − g and P 0 E 0 = D 0 ( 1 + g ) / E 0 r − g = ( 1 − b ) ( 1 + g ) r − g . The foregoing expressions give a stock’s justified price-to-earnings ratio based on forecasts of fundamentals (given that the Gordon growth model is appropriate). The Gordon growth model may be useful for valuing broad-based equity indexes and the stock of businesses with earnings that are expected to grow at a stable rate comparable to or lower than the economy’s nominal growth rate. Gordon growth model values are very sensitive to the assumed growth rate and required rate of return. For many companies, growth falls into phases. In the growth phase, a company enjoys an abnormally high growth rate in earnings per share, called supernormal growth. In the transition phase, earnings growth slows. In the mature phase, the company reaches an equilibrium in which such factors as earnings growth and the return on equity stabilize at levels that can be sustained long term. Analysts often apply multistage DCF models to value the stock of a company with multistage growth prospects. The two-stage dividend discount model assumes different growth rates in Stage 1 and Stage 2: V 0 = ∑ t = 1 n D 0 ( 1 + g S ) t ( 1 + r ) t + D 0 ( 1 + g S ) n ( 1 + g L ) ( 1 + r ) n ( r − g L ) , where g S is the expected dividend growth rate in the first period and g L is the expected growth rate in the second period. The terminal stock value, V n , is sometimes found with the Gordon growth model or with some other method, such as applying a P/E multiplier to forecasted EPS as of the terminal date. The H-model assumes that the dividend growth rate declines linearly from a high supernormal rate to the normal growth rate during Stage 1 and then grows at a constant normal growth rate thereafter: V 0 = D 0 ( 1 + g L ) r − g L + D 0 H ( g S − g L ) r − g L = D 0 ( 1 + g L ) + D 0 H ( g S − g L ) r − g L . There are two basic three-stage models. In one version, the growth rate in the middle stage is constant. In the second version, the growth rate declines linearly in Stage 2 and becomes constant and normal in Stage 3. In addition to valuing equities, the IRR of a DDM, assuming assets are correctly priced in the marketplace, has been used to estimate required returns. For simpler models (such as the one-period model, the Gordon growth model, and the H-model), well-known formulas may be used to calculate these rates of return. For many dividend streams, however, the rate of return must be found by trial and error, producing a discount rate that equates the present value of the forecasted dividend stream to the current market price. Multistage DDM models can accommodate a wide variety of patterns of expected dividends. Even though such models may use stylized assumptions about growth, they can provide useful approximations. Dividend growth rates can be obtained from analyst forecasts, statistical forecasting models, or company fundamentals. The sustainable growth rate depends on the ROE and the earnings retention rate, b : g = b × ROE. This expression can be expanded further, using the DuPont formula, as g = Net income − Dividends Net income × Net income Sales × Sales Total assets × Total assets Shareholders' equity .

Conceptually, residual income is net income less a charge (deduction) for common shareholders’ opportunity cost in generating net income. It is the residual or remaining income after considering the costs of all of a company’s capital. The appeal of residual income models stems from a shortcoming of traditional accounting. Specifically, although a company’s income statement includes a charge for the cost of debt capital in the form of interest expense, it does not include a charge for the cost of equity capital. A company can have positive net income but may still not be adding value for shareholders if it does not earn more than its cost of equity capital. Residual income models explicitly recognize the costs of all the capital used in generating income. As an economic concept, residual income has a long history, dating back to Alfred Marshall in the late 1800s (Alfred Marshall, 1890). As far back as the 1920s, General Motors used the concept in evaluating business segments. More recently, residual income has received renewed attention and interest, sometimes under names such as economic profit, abnormal earnings, or economic value added. Although residual income concepts have been used in a variety of contexts, including the measurement of internal corporate performance, we will focus on the residual income model for estimating the intrinsic value of common stock. Among the questions we will study to help us apply residual income models are the following: How is residual income measured, and how can an analyst use residual income in valuation? How does residual income relate to fundamentals, such as return on equity and earnings growth rates? How is residual income linked to other valuation methods, such as a price-multiple approach? What accounting-based challenges arise in applying residual income valuation? The following section develops the concept of residual income, introduces the use of residual income in valuation, and briefly presents alternative measures used in practice. The subsequent sections present the residual income model and illustrate its use in valuing common stock, show practical applications, and describe the relative strengths and weaknesses of residual income valuation compared with other valuation methods. The last section addresses accounting issues in the use of residual income valuation. We then conclude with a summary.","The member should be able to: calculate and interpret residual income, economic value added, and market value added; describe the uses of residual income models; calculate the intrinsic value of a common stock using the residual income model and compare value recognition in residual income and other present value models; explain fundamental determinants of residual income; explain the relation between residual income valuation and the justified price-to-book ratio based on forecasted fundamentals; calculate and interpret the intrinsic value of a common stock using single-stage (constant-growth) and multistage residual income models; calculate the implied growth rate in residual income, given the market price-to-book ratio and an estimate of the required rate of return on equity; explain continuing residual income and justify an estimate of continuing residual income at the forecast horizon, given company and industry prospects; compare residual income models to dividend discount and free cash flow models; explain strengths and weaknesses of residual income models and justify the selection of a residual income model to value a company’s common stock; describe accounting issues in applying residual income models; evaluate whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued based on a residual income model.","We have discussed the use of residual income models in valuation. Residual income is an appealing economic concept because it attempts to measure economic profit, which are profits after accounting for all opportunity costs of capital. Residual income is calculated as net income minus a deduction for the cost of equity capital. The deduction, called the equity charge, is equal to equity capital multiplied by the required rate of return on equity (the cost of equity capital in percent). Economic value added (EVA) is a commercial implementation of the residual income concept. EVA = NOPAT − (C% × TC), where NOPAT is net operating profit after taxes, C% is the percent cost of capital, and TC is total capital. Residual income models (including commercial implementations) are used not only for equity valuation but also to measure internal corporate performance and for determining executive compensation. We can forecast per-share residual income as forecasted earnings per share minus the required rate of return on equity multiplied by beginning book value per share. Alternatively, per-share residual income can be forecasted as beginning book value per share multiplied by the difference between forecasted ROE and the required rate of return on equity. In the residual income model, the intrinsic value of a share of common stock is the sum of book value per share and the present value of expected future per-share residual income. In the residual income model, the equivalent mathematical expressions for intrinsic value of a common stock are V 0 = B 0 + ∑ t = 1 ∞ RI t ( 1 + r ) t = B 0 + ∑ t = 1 ∞ E t − r B t − 1 ( 1 + r ) t = B 0 + ∑ t = 1 ∞ ( ROE t − r ) B t − 1 ( 1 + r ) t where V 0 = value of a share of stock today ( t = 0) B 0 = current per-share book value of equity B t = expected per-share book value of equity at any time t r = required rate of return on equity (cost of equity) E t = expected earnings per share for period t RI t = expected per-share residual income, equal to E t − rB t –1 or to (ROE − r ) × B t –1 ROE T = return on equity • In the two-stage model with continuing residual income in stage two, the intrinsic value of a share of stock is V 0 = B 0 + ∑ t = 1 T RI t ( 1 + r ) t + P T − B T ( 1 + r ) T = B 0 + ∑ t = 1 T ( E t − r B t − 1 ) ( 1 + r ) t + P T − B T ( 1 + r ) T V 0 = B 0 + ∑ t = 1 T ( ROE t − r ) B t − 1 ( 1 + r ) t + P T − B T ( 1 + r ) T where P T = expected per share price at terminal time T B T = expected per share book value at terminal time T

Evaluating how ESG factors potentially affect a company may provide analysts with a broader perspective on the risks and investment opportunities of a company’s securities. Although corporate governance has long been recognized as having a significant impact on a company’s long-term performance, investors have become increasingly concerned with environmental and social factors and how companies manage their resources and risk exposures that relate to such factors. Mismanagement of these resources has led to a number of high-profile corporate events that have negatively affected security prices. Increasingly stringent regulatory environments, potentially finite supplies of natural resources, and global trends toward energy conservation and waste reduction have led many investors to place greater emphasis on the management of environmental risks. Similarly, such issues as worker health and safety policies, community impact, and marketing practices have increased the visibility of how a company manages its social capital. This reading provides an overview of ESG considerations in investment analysis. Section 2 provides an overview of the global variations in corporate ownership structures, as well as how these ownership structures may affect corporate governance outcomes. In Section 3, we discuss company-specific factors that should be considered when evaluating corporate governance in the investment process. Section 4 discusses the identification of ESG-related risks and opportunities that are relevant to security analysis. Section 5 demonstrates the evaluation of ESG-related risks and opportunities through several examples. The reading concludes with a summary of the key points discussed.",The member should be able to: describe global variations in ownership structures and the possible effects of these variations on corporate governance policies and practices; evaluate the effectiveness of a company’s corporate governance policies and practices; describe how ESG-related risk exposures and investment opportunities may be identified and evaluated; evaluate ESG risk exposures and investment opportunities related to a company.,"Shareholder ownership structures are commonly classified as dispersed, concentrated, or a hybrid of the two. Dispersed ownership reflects the existence of many shareholders, none of which, either individually or collectively, has the ability to exercise control over the corporation. Concentrated corporate ownership reflects an individual shareholder or a group (controlling shareholders) with the ability to exercise control over the corporation. Controlling shareholders may be either majority shareholders or minority shareholders. Horizontal ownership involves companies with mutual business interests that have cross-holding share arrangements with each other. Vertical (or pyramid) ownership involves a company or group that has a controlling interest in two or more holding companies, which in turn have controlling interests in various operating companies. Dual-class (or multiple-class) shares grant one or more share classes superior or even sole voting rights while other share classes have inferior or no voting rights. Types of influential owners include banks, families, sovereign governments, institutional investors, group companies, private equity firms, foreign investors, managers, and board directors. A corporation’s board of directors is typically structured as either one tier or two tier. A one-tier board consists of a single board of directors, composed of executive (internal) and non-executive (external) directors. A two-tier board consists of a supervisory board that oversees a management board. CEO duality exists when the chief executive officer also serves as chairperson of the board. A primary challenge of integrating ESG factors into investment analysis is identifying and obtaining information that is relevant, comparable, and decision-useful. ESG information and metrics are inconsistently reported by companies, and such disclosure is voluntary, which provides additional challenges for analysts. In an ESG context, materiality typically refers to ESG-related issues that are expected to affect a company’s operations or financial performance and the valuation of its securities. Corporate governance considerations, such as the structure of the board of directors, tend to be reasonably consistent across most companies. In contrast, environmental and social considerations often differ greatly. Analysts typically use three main sources of information to identify a company’s (or industry’s) ESG factors: (1) proprietary research, (2) ratings and analysis from ESG data providers, or (3) research from not-for-profit industry organizations and initiatives. In equity analysis, ESG integration is used to both identify potential opportunities and mitigate downside risk, whereas in fixed-income analysis, ESG integration is generally focused on mitigating downside risk. A typical starting point for ESG integration is the identification of material qualitative and quantitative ESG factors that pertain to a company or its industry.

Rather than try to apply every possible technique and tool to every situation, it is essential for the investor to consider and identify the proper type of analysis to apply in a given situation. The primary reason for performing financial analysis is to help in making an economic decision. Before making such decisions as whether to lend to a particular long-term borrower or to invest a large sum in a common stock, venture capital vehicle, or private equity candidate, an investor or financial decision-maker wants to make sure that the probability of a successful outcome is on his or her side. Rather than leave outcomes to chance, a financial decision-maker should use financial analysis to identify and make more visible potential favorable and unfavorable outcomes. The purpose of this reading is to provide examples of the effective use of financial analysis in decision making. The framework for the analysis is shown in . The case study follows the basic framework shown in . Exhibit 1.

Although each analysis undertaken may have a different focus, purpose, and context that result in the application of different techniques and tools, the case demonstrates the use of a common financial statement analysis framework. The analyst starts with a global, summarized view of a company and its attributes and digs below the surface of the financial statements to find economic truths that are not apparent from a superficial review. In the case of Nestlé, the analyst applied disaggregation techniques to review the company’s performance in terms of ROE and then successively examined the drivers of ROE in increasing detail to evaluate management’s skills in capital allocation. An economic decision is reached, which is consistent with the primary reason for performing financial analysis: to facilitate an economic decision.

It is an important topic because regulation has potential effects not only at the macro level on the economy but also at the micro level on companies and individuals. Regulation may develop either proactively in anticipation of consequences of changes in the market environment or reactively in response to some occurrence(s). For example, changes that resulted from technological advances in the markets because of new means of communication and applications of computers have led to a variety of regulation, both proactive and reactive. Regulation has also developed in response to financial crises and undesirable behaviors or actions that have occurred in the past. Regulations are necessary because in some situations market solutions are inadequate. In other words, regulations exist to protect end users from market failings. A significant challenge for financial regulators is how to deal with systemic risk (the risk of failure of the financial system) and the consequences of risk taking by financial institutions. Issues such as labor regulation, environmental regulation, and electronic privacy are also receiving increased attention. How regulations are developed and applied can have significant impacts on businesses. Changes in regulatory framework and regulatory uncertainty can also have substantial effects on business decisions. So, one of the significant challenges facing professionals in the finance industry is to anticipate and understand the consequences of potential changes in the regulatory environment and of specific regulations. In the following sections, we describe the economic rationale of regulation, including how regulation improves fairness in markets and addresses the danger to society of financial system failure. We also provide an overview of regulators, the tools at their disposal, and how the work of regulators around the globe is interdependent. Lastly, we describe the assessment of costs and benefits of regulation and highlight practical issues that arise from the implementation of regulation.",The member should be able to: describe the economic rationale for regulatory intervention; explain the purposes of regulating commerce and financial markets; describe anticompetitive behaviors targeted by antitrust laws globally and evaluate the antitrust risk associated with a given business strategy; describe classifications of regulations and regulators; describe uses of self-regulation in financial markets; describe regulatory interdependencies and their effects; describe tools of regulatory intervention in markets; describe benefits and costs of regulation; describe the considerations when evaluating the effects of regulation on an industry.,"Knowledge of regulation is important because regulation has potentially far-reaching and significant effects. These effects can range from macro-level effects on the economy to micro-level effects on individual entities and securities. Regulation originates from a variety of sources and in a variety of areas. A framework that includes types of regulators and regulation as well as areas of regulation that may affect the entity of interest (including the economy as an entity) is useful. The framework will help in assessing possible effects of new regulation. It can also help in assessing the effects of regulation on various entities. More than one regulator may develop regulations in response to a particular issue. Each of the relevant regulators may have different objectives and choose to address the issue using different regulatory tools. In developing regulations, the regulator should consider costs and benefits. In the analysis, the net regulatory burden (private costs less private benefits of regulation) may also be relevant. Potential costs and benefits, regardless of the perspective, may be difficult to assess. A critical aspect of regulatory analysis, however, is assessing the costs and benefits of regulation. The following are some key points of the reading. The existence of informational frictions and externalities creates a need for regulation. Regulation is expected to have societal benefits and should be assessed using cost–benefit analysis. The regulation of securities markets and financial institutions is extensive and complex because of the consequences of failures in the financial system. These consequences include financial losses, loss of confidence, and disruption of commerce. The focus of regulators in financial markets includes prudential supervision, financial stability, market integrity, and economic growth. Regulatory competition is competition among different regulatory bodies to use regulation in order to attract certain entities. The breadth of regulation of commerce necessitates the use of a framework that identifies potential areas of regulation. This framework can be referenced to identify specific areas of regulation, both existing and anticipated, that may affect the entity of interest. Legislative bodies, regulatory bodies, and courts typically enact regulation. Regulatory bodies include government agencies and independent regulators granted authority by a government or governmental agency. Some independent regulators are self-regulating organizations. Typically, legislative bodies enact broad laws or statutes. Regulatory bodies issue administrative regulations, often implementing statutes. Courts interpret statutes and administrative regulations; these interpretations may result in judicial law. Interdependence in the actions and potentially conflicting objectives of regulators is an important consideration for regulators, regulated entities, and those assessing the effects of regulation. Regulation that arises to enhance the interests of regulated entities reflects regulatory capture. Regulators have responsibility for both substantive and procedural laws. The former focuses on rights and responsibilities of entities and relationships among entities. The latter focuses on the protection and enforcement of the former. Regulatory arbitrage is the use of regulation by an entity to exploit differences in economic substance and regulatory interpretation or in regulatory regimes to the entity’s benefit. There are many regulatory tools available to regulators, including regulatory mandates and restrictions on behaviors, provision of public goods, and public financing of private projects. The choice of regulatory tool should be consistent with maintaining a stable regulatory environment. “Stable” does not mean unchanging but, rather, refers to desirable attributes of regulation, including predictability, effectiveness in achieving objectives, time consistency, and enforceability. In assessing regulation and regulatory outcomes, regulators should conduct ongoing cost–benefit analyses, develop techniques to enhance the measurement of these outcomes, and use economic principles to guide them. Net regulatory burden to the entity of interest is an important consideration for analysts.

The term structure of interest rates—market interest rates at various maturities—is a vital input into the valuation of many financial products. The quantification of interest rate risk is of critical importance to risk managers. Understanding the determinants of interest rates, and thus the drivers of bond returns, is imperative for fixed-income market participants. Here, we explore the tools necessary to understand the term structure and interest rate dynamics—that is, the process by which bond yields and prices evolve over time. Section 1 explains how spot (or current) rates and forward rates, which are set today for a period starting in the future, are related, as well as how their relationship influences yield curve shape. Section 2 builds upon this foundation to show how forward rates impact the yield-to-maturity and expected bond returns. Section 3 explains how these concepts are put into practice by active fixed-income portfolio managers. The swap curve is the term structure of interest rates derived from a periodic exchange of payments based on fixed rates versus short-term market reference rates rather than default-risk-free government bonds. Sections 4 and 5 describe the swap curve and its relationship to government yields, known as the swap spread, and explains their use in valuation. Section 6 describes traditional theories of the term structure of interest rates. These theories outline several qualitative perspectives on economic forces that may affect the shape of the term structure. Section 7 describes yield curve factor models. The focus is a popular three-factor term structure model in which the yield curve changes are described in terms of three independent movements: level, steepness, and curvature. These factors can be extracted from the variance-covariance matrix of historical interest rate movements. Section 8 builds on the factor model and describes how to manage the risk of changing rates over different maturities. Section 9 concludes with a discussion of key variables known to influence interest rates, the development of interest rate views based on forecasts of those variables, and common trades tailored to capitalize on an interest rate view. A summary of key points concludes the reading.","The member should be able to: describe relationships among spot rates, forward rates, yield to maturity, expected and realized returns on bonds, and the shape of the yield curve; describe how zero-coupon rates (spot rates) may be obtained from the par curve by bootstrapping; describe the assumptions concerning the evolution of spot rates in relation to forward rates implicit in active bond portfolio management; describe the strategy of rolling down the yield curve; explain the swap rate curve and why and how market participants use it in valuation; calculate and interpret the swap spread for a given maturity; describe short-term interest rate spreads used to gauge economy-wide credit risk and liquidity risk; explain traditional theories of the term structure of interest rates and describe the implications of each theory for forward rates and the shape of the yield curve; explain how a bond’s exposure to each of the factors driving the yield curve can be measured and how these exposures can be used to manage yield curve risks; explain the maturity structure of yield volatilities and their effect on price volatility; explain how key economic factors are used to establish a view on benchmark rates, spreads, and yield curve changes.","The spot rate for a given maturity can be expressed as a geometric average of the short-term rate and a series of forward rates. Forward rates are above (below) spot rates when the spot curve is upward (downward) sloping, whereas forward rates are equal to spot rates when the spot curve is flat. If forward rates are realized, then all bonds, regardless of maturity, will have the same one-period realized return, which is the first-period spot rate. If the spot rate curve is upward sloping and is unchanged, then each bond “rolls down” the curve and earns the forward rate that rolls out of its pricing (i.e., an N -period zero-coupon bond earns the N -period forward rate as it rolls down to be a N – 1 period security). This dynamic implies an expected return in excess of short-maturity bonds (i.e., a term premium) for longer-maturity bonds if the yield curve is upward sloping. Active bond portfolio management is consistent with the expectation that today’s forward curve does not accurately reflect future spot rates. The swap curve provides another measure of the time value of money. Swaps are an essential tool frequently used by investors to hedge, take a position in, or otherwise modify interest rate risk. Bond quote conventions often use measures of spreads. Those quoted spreads can be used to determine a bond’s price. Swap curves and Treasury curves can differ because of differences in their credit exposures, liquidity, and other supply/demand factors. Market participants often use interest rate spreads between short-term government and risky rates as a barometer to evaluate relative credit and liquidity risk. The local expectations theory, liquidity preference theory, segmented markets theory, and preferred habitat theory provide traditional explanations for the shape of the yield curve. Historical yield curve movements suggest that they can be explained by a linear combination of three principal movements: level, steepness, and curvature. The volatility term structure can be measured using historical data and depicts yield curve risk. The sensitivity of a bond value to yield curve changes may make use of effective duration, key rate durations, or sensitivities to parallel, steepness, and curvature movements. Using key rate durations or sensitivities to parallel, steepness, and curvature movements allows one to measure and manage shaping risk. The term bond risk premium refers to the expected excess return of a default-free long-term bond less that of an equivalent short-term bond or the one-period risk-free rate Several macroeconomic factors influence bond pricing and required returns such as inflation, economic growth, and monetary policy, among others. During highly uncertain market periods, investors flock to government bonds in a flight to quality that is often associated with bullish flattening, in which long-term rates fall by more than short-term rates. Investors expecting rates to fall will generally extend (shorten) portfolio duration to take advantage of expected bond price increases (decreases) When investors expect a steeper (flatter) curve under which long-term rates rise (fall) relative to short-term rates, they will sell (buy) long-term bonds and purchase (sell) short-term bonds.

We use the concepts and tools of hypothesis testing to address these issues. Hypothesis testing is part of statistical inference, the process of making judgments about a larger group (a population) based on a smaller group of observations (that is, a sample). The concepts and tools of hypothesis testing provide an objective means to gauge whether the available evidence supports the hypothesis. After applying a statistical test of a hypothesis, we should have a clearer idea of the probability that a hypothesis is true or not, although our conclusion always stops short of certainty. The main focus of this reading is on the framework of hypothesis testing and tests concerning mean, variance, and correlation, three quantities frequently used in investments.","The member should be able to: define a hypothesis, describe the steps of hypothesis testing, and describe and interpret the choice of the null and alternative hypotheses; compare and contrast one-tailed and two-tailed tests of hypotheses; explain a test statistic, Type I and Type II errors, a significance level, how significance levels are used in hypothesis testing, and the power of a test; explain a decision rule and the relation between confidence intervals and hypothesis tests, and determine whether a statistically significant result is also economically meaningful. explain and interpret the p-value as it relates to hypothesis testing; describe how to interpret the significance of a test in the context of multiple tests; identify the appropriate test statistic and interpret the results for a hypothesis test concerning the population mean of both large and small samples when the population is normally or approximately normally distributed and the variance is (1) known or (2) unknown; identify the appropriate test statistic and interpret the results for a hypothesis test concerning the equality of the population means of two at least approximately normally distributed populations based on independent random samples with equal assumed variances; identify the appropriate test statistic and interpret the results for a hypothesis test concerning the mean difference of two normally distributed populations; identify the appropriate test statistic and interpret the results for a hypothesis test concerning (1) the variance of a normally distributed population and (2) the equality of the variances of two normally distributed populations based on two independent random samples; compare and contrast parametric and nonparametric tests, and describe situations where each is the more appropriate type of test; explain parametric and nonparametric tests of the hypothesis that the population correlation coefficient equals zero, and determine whether the hypothesis is rejected at a given level of significance; explain tests of independence based on contingency table data.","In this reading, we have presented the concepts and methods of statistical inference and hypothesis testing. A hypothesis is a statement about one or more populations. The steps in testing a hypothesis are as follows: State the hypotheses. Identify the appropriate test statistic and its probability distribution. Specify the significance level. State the decision rule. Collect the data and calculate the test statistic. Make a decision. We state two hypotheses: The null hypothesis is the hypothesis to be tested; the alternative hypothesis is the hypothesis accepted if the null hypothesis is rejected. There are three ways to formulate hypotheses. Let q indicate the population parameters: Two-sided alternative: H 0 : θ = θ 0 versus H a : θ ¹ θ 0 One-sided alternative (right side): H 0 : θ £ θ 0 versus H a : θ > θ 0 One-sided alternative (left side): H 0 : θ ³ θ 0 versus H a : θ < θ 0 where θ 0 is a hypothesized value of the population parameter and θ is the true value of the population parameter. When we have a “suspected” or “hoped for” condition for which we want to find supportive evidence, we frequently set up that condition as the alternative hypothesis and use a one-sided test. However, the researcher may select a “not equal to” alternative hypothesis and conduct a two-sided test to emphasize a neutral attitude. A test statistic is a quantity, calculated using a sample, whose value is the basis for deciding whether to reject or not reject the null hypothesis. We compare the computed value of the test statistic to a critical value for the same test statistic to decide whether to reject or not reject the null hypothesis. In reaching a statistical decision, we can make two possible errors: We may reject a true null hypothesis (a Type I error, or false positive), or we may fail to reject a false null hypothesis (a Type II error, or false negative). The level of significance of a test is the probability of a Type I error that we accept in conducting a hypothesis test. The standard approach to hypothesis testing involves specifying only a level of significance (that is, the probability of a Type I error). The complement of the level of significance is the confidence level. The power of a test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null (rejecting the null when it is false). The complement of the power of the test is the probability of a Type II error. A decision rule consists of determining the critical values with which to compare the test statistic to decide whether to reject or not reject the null hypothesis. When we reject the null hypothesis, the result is said to be statistically significant. The (1 − a ) confidence interval represents the range of values of the test statistic for which the null hypothesis is not be rejected. The statistical decision consists of rejecting or not rejecting the null hypothesis. The economic decision takes into consideration all economic issues pertinent to the decision. The p -value is the smallest level of significance at which the null hypothesis can be rejected. The smaller the p -value, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis and in favor of the alternative hypothesis. The p -value approach to hypothesis testing involves computing a p -value for the test statistic and allowing the user of the research to interpret the implications for the null hypothesis. For hypothesis tests concerning the population mean of a normally distributed population with unknown variance, the theoretically correct test statistic is the t -statistic. When we want to test whether the observed difference between two means is statistically significant, we must first decide whether the samples are independent or dependent (related). If the samples are independent, we conduct a test concerning differences between means. If the samples are dependent, we conduct a test of mean differences (paired comparisons test). When we conduct a test of the difference between two population means from normally distributed populations with unknown but equal variances, we use a t -test based on pooling the observations of the two samples to estimate the common but unknown variance. This test is based on an assumption of independent samples. In tests concerning two means based on two samples that are not independent, we often can arrange the data in paired observations and conduct a test of mean differences (a paired comparisons test). When the samples are from normally distributed populations with unknown variances, the appropriate test statistic is t -distributed. In tests concerning the variance of a single normally distributed population, the test statistic is chi-square with n − 1 degrees of freedom, where n is sample size. For tests concerning differences between the variances of two normally distributed populations based on two random, independent samples, the appropriate test statistic is based on an F -test (the ratio of the sample variances). The degrees of freedom for this F -test are n 1 − 1 and n 2 − 1, where n 1 corresponds to the number of observations in the calculation of the numerator and n 2 is the number of observations in the calculation of the denominator of the F -statistic. A parametric test is a hypothesis test concerning a population parameter or a hypothesis test based on specific distributional assumptions. In contrast, a nonparametric test either is not concerned with a parameter or makes minimal assumptions about the population from which the sample comes. A nonparametric test is primarily used when data do not meet distributional assumptions, when there are outliers, when data are given in ranks, or when the hypothesis we are addressing does not concern a parameter. In tests concerning correlation, we use a t -statistic to test whether a population correlation coefficient is different from zero. If we have n observations for two variables, this test statistic has a t -distribution with n − 2 degrees of freedom. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient is calculated on the ranks of two variables within their respective samples. A chi-square distributed test statistic is used to test for independence of two categorical variables. This nonparametric test compares actual frequencies with those expected on the basis of independence. This test statistic has degrees of freedom of ( r − 1)( c − 2), where r is the number of categories for the first variable and c is the number of categories of the second variable.

The business of currency forecasting can be a humbling experience. Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board, famously noted that “having endeavored to forecast exchange rates for more than half a century, I have understandably developed significant humility about my ability in this area.” Hence, our discussion is not about predicting exchange rates but about the tools the reader can use to better understand long-run equilibrium value. This outlook helps guide the market participant’s decisions with respect to risk exposures, as well as whether currency hedges should be implemented and, if so, how they should be managed. After discussing the basics of exchange rate transactions, we present the main theories for currency determination—starting with the international parity conditions—and then describe other important influences, such as current account balances, capital flows, and monetary and fiscal policy. Although these fundamentals-based models usually perform poorly in predicting future exchange rates in the short run, they are crucial for understanding long-term currency value. Thus, we proceed as follows: We review the basic concepts of the foreign exchange market covered in the CFA Program Level I curriculum and expand this previous coverage to incorporate more material on bid–offer spreads. We then begin to examine determinants of exchange rates, starting with longer-term interrelationships among exchange rates, interest rates, and inflation rates embodied in the international parity conditions. These parity conditions form the key building blocks for many long-run exchange rate models. We also examine the foreign exchange (FX) carry trade, a trading strategy that exploits deviations from uncovered interest rate parity and discuss the relationship between a country’s exchange rate and its balance of payments. We then examine how monetary and fiscal policies can indirectly affect exchange rates by influencing the various factors described in our exchange rate model. The subsequent section focuses on direct public sector actions in foreign exchange markets, both through capital controls and by foreign exchange market intervention (buying and selling currencies for policy purposes). The last section examines historical episodes of currency crisis and some leading indicators that may signal the increased likelihood of a crisis. We conclude with a summary.","The member should be able to: calculate and interpret the bid–offer spread on a spot or forward currency quotation and describe the factors that affect the bid–offer spread; identify a triangular arbitrage opportunity and calculate its profit, given the bid–offer quotations for three currencies; distinguish between spot and forward rates and calculate the forward premium/discount for a given currency; calculate the mark-to-market value of a forward contract; explain international parity conditions (covered and uncovered interest rate parity, forward rate parity, purchasing power parity, and the international Fisher effect); describe relations among the international parity conditions; evaluate the use of the current spot rate, the forward rate, purchasing power parity, and uncovered interest parity to forecast future spot exchange rates; explain approaches to assessing the long-run fair value of an exchange rate; describe the carry trade and its relation to uncovered interest rate parity and calculate the profit from a carry trade; explain how flows in the balance of payment accounts affect currency exchange rates; explain the potential effects of monetary and fiscal policy on exchange rates; describe objectives of central bank or government intervention and capital controls and describe the effectiveness of intervention and capital controls; describe warning signs of a currency crisis.","Exchange rates are among the most difficult financial market prices to understand and therefore to value. There is no simple, robust framework that investors can rely on in assessing the appropriate level and likely movements of exchange rates. Most economists believe that there is an equilibrium level or a path to that equilibrium value that a currency will gravitate toward in the long run. Although short- and medium-term cyclical deviations from the long-run equilibrium path can be sizable and persistent, fundamental forces should eventually drive the currency back toward its long-run equilibrium path. Evidence suggests that misalignments tend to build up gradually over time. As these misalignments build, they are likely to generate serious economic imbalances that will eventually lead to correction of the underlying exchange rate misalignment. We have described how changes in monetary policy, fiscal policy, current account trends, and capital flows affect exchange rate trends, as well as what role government intervention and capital controls can play in counteracting potentially undesirable exchange rate movements. We have made the following key points: Spot exchange rates apply to trades for the next settlement date (usually T + 2) for a given currency pair. Forward exchange rates apply to trades to be settled at any longer maturity. Market makers quote bid and offer prices (in terms of the price currency ) at which they will buy or sell the base currency. The offer price is always higher than the bid price. The counterparty that asks for a two-sided price quote has the option (but not the obligation) to deal at either the bid or offer price quoted. The bid–offer spread depends on (1) the currency pair involved, (2) the time of day, (3) market volatility, (4) the transaction size, and (5) the relationship between the dealer and the client. Spreads are tightest in highly liquid currency pairs, when the key market centers are open, and when market volatility is relatively low. Absence of arbitrage requires the following: The bid (offer) shown by a dealer in the interbank market cannot be higher (lower) than the current interbank offer (bid) price. The cross-rate bids (offers) posted by a dealer must be lower (higher) than the implied cross-rate offers (bids) available in the interbank market. If they are not, then a triangular arbitrage opportunity arises. Forward exchange rates are quoted in terms of points to be added to the spot exchange rate. If the points are positive (negative), the base currency is trading at a forward premium (discount). The points are proportional to the interest rate differential and approximately proportional to the time to maturity. International parity conditions show us how expected inflation, interest rate differentials, forward exchange rates, and expected future spot exchange rates are linked. In an ideal world, relative expected inflation rates should determine relative nominal interest rates, relative interest rates should determine forward exchange rates, and forward exchange rates should correctly anticipate the path of the future spot exchange rate. International parity conditions tell us that countries with high (low) expected inflation rates should see their currencies depreciate (appreciate) over time, that high-yield currencies should depreciate relative to low-yield currencies over time, and that forward exchange rates should function as unbiased predictors of future spot exchange rates. With the exception of covered interest rate parity, which is enforced by arbitrage, the key international parity conditions rarely hold in either the short or medium term. However, the parity conditions tend to hold over relatively long horizons. According to the theory of covered interest rate parity, a foreign-currency-denominated money market investment that is completely hedged against exchange rate risk in the forward market should yield exactly the same return as an otherwise identical domestic money market investment. According to the theory of uncovered interest rate parity, the expected change in a domestic currency’s value should be fully reflected in domestic–foreign interest rate spreads. Hence, an unhedged foreign-currency-denominated money market investment is expected to yield the same return as an otherwise identical domestic money market investment. According to the ex ante purchasing power parity condition, expected changes in exchange rates should equal the difference in expected national inflation rates. If both ex ante purchasing power parity and uncovered interest rate parity held, real interest rates across all markets would be the same. This result is real interest rate parity. The international Fisher effect says that the nominal interest rate differential between two currencies equals the difference between the expected inflation rates. The international Fisher effect assumes that risk premiums are the same throughout the world. If both covered and uncovered interest rate parity held, then forward rate parity would hold and the market would set the forward exchange rate equal to the expected spot exchange rate: The forward exchange rate would serve as an unbiased predictor of the future spot exchange rate. Most studies have found that high-yield currencies do not depreciate and low-yield currencies do not appreciate as much as yield spreads would suggest over short to medium periods, thus violating the theory of uncovered interest rate parity. Carry trades overweight high-yield currencies at the expense of low-yield currencies. Historically, carry trades have generated attractive returns in benign market conditions but tend to perform poorly (i.e., are subject to crash risk) when market conditions are highly volatile. According to a balance of payments approach, countries that run persistent current account deficits will generally see their currencies weaken over time. Similarly, countries that run persistent current account surpluses will tend to see their currencies appreciate over time. Large current account imbalances can persist for long periods of time before they trigger an adjustment in exchange rates. Greater financial integration of the world’s capital markets and greater freedom of capital to flow across national borders have increased the importance of global capital flows in determining exchange rates. Countries that institute relatively tight monetary policies, introduce structural economic reforms, and lower budget deficits will often see their currencies strengthen over time as capital flows respond positively to relatively high nominal interest rates, lower inflation expectations, a lower risk premium, and an upward revision in the market’s assessment of what exchange rate level constitutes long-run fair value. Monetary policy affects the exchange rate through a variety of channels. In the Mundell–Fleming model, it does so primarily through the interest rate sensitivity of capital flows, strengthening the currency when monetary policy is tightened and weakening it when monetary policy is eased. The more sensitive capital flows are to the change in interest rates, the greater the exchange rate’s responsiveness to the change in monetary policy. In the monetary model of exchange rate determination, monetary policy is deemed to have a direct impact on the actual and expected path of inflation, which, via purchasing power parity, translates into a corresponding impact on the exchange rate. Countries that pursue overly easy monetary policies will see their currencies depreciate over time. In the Mundell–Fleming model, an expansionary fiscal policy typically results in a rise in domestic interest rates and an increase in economic activity. The rise in domestic interest rates should induce a capital inflow, which is positive for the domestic currency, but the rise in economic activity should contribute to a deterioration of the trade balance, which is negative for the domestic currency. The more mobile capital flows are, the greater the likelihood that the induced inflow of capital will dominate the deterioration in trade. Under conditions of high capital mobility, countries that simultaneously pursue expansionary fiscal policies and relatively tight monetary policies should see their currencies strengthen over time. The portfolio balance model of exchange rate determination asserts that increases in government debt resulting from a rising budget deficit will be willingly held by investors only if they are compensated in the form of a higher expected return. The higher expected return could come from (1) higher interest rates and/or a higher risk premium, (2) depreciation of the currency to a level sufficient to generate anticipation of gains from subsequent currency appreciation, or (3) some combination of the two. Surges in capital inflows can fuel boom-like conditions, asset price bubbles, and currency overvaluation. Many consider capital controls to be a legitimate part of a policymaker’s toolkit. The IMF believes that capital controls may be needed to prevent exchange rates from overshooting, asset price bubbles from forming, and future financial conditions from deteriorating. The evidence indicates that government policies have had a significant impact on the course of exchange rates. Relative to developed countries, emerging markets may have greater success in managing their exchange rates because of their large foreign exchange reserve holdings, which appear sizable relative to the limited turnover of FX transactions in many emerging markets. Although each currency crisis is distinct in some respects, the following factors were identified in one or more studies: Prior to a currency crisis, the capital markets have been liberalized to allow the free flow of capital. There are large inflows of foreign capital (relative to GDP) in the period leading up to a crisis, with short-term funding denominated in a foreign currency being particularly problematic. Currency crises are often preceded by (and often coincide with) banking crises. Countries with fixed or partially fixed exchange rates are more susceptible to currency crises than countries with floating exchange rates. Foreign exchange reserves tend to decline precipitously as a crisis approaches. In the period leading up to a crisis, the currency has risen substantially relative to its historical mean. The terms of trade (exports relative to imports) often deteriorate before a crisis. Broad money growth and the ratio of M2 (a measure of money supply) to bank reserves tend to rise prior to a crisis. Inflation tends to be significantly higher in pre-crisis periods compared with tranquil periods.

When applied to dividends, the DCF model is the discounted dividend approach or dividend discount model (DDM). Our coverage extends DCF analysis to value a company and its equity securities by valuing free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE). Whereas dividends are the cash flows actually paid to stockholders, free cash flows are the cash flows available for distribution to shareholders. Unlike dividends, FCFF and FCFE are not readily available data. Analysts need to compute these quantities from available financial information, which requires a clear understanding of free cash flows and the ability to interpret and use the information correctly. Forecasting future free cash flows is a rich and demanding exercise. The analyst’s understanding of a company’s financial statements, its operations, its financing, and its industry can pay real “dividends” as he or she addresses that task. Many analysts consider free cash flow models to be more useful than DDMs in practice. Free cash flows provide an economically sound basis for valuation. A study of professional analysts substantiates the importance of free cash flow valuation (Pinto, Robinson, Stowe 2019). When valuing individual equities, 92.8% of analysts use market multiples and 78.8% use a discounted cash flow approach. When using discounted cash flow analysis, 20.5% of analysts use a residual income approach, 35.1% use a dividend discount model, and 86.9% use a discounted free cash flow model. Of those using discounted free cash flow models, FCFF models are used roughly twice as frequently as FCFE models. Analysts often use more than one method to value equities, and it is clear that free cash flow analysis is in near universal use. Analysts like to use free cash flow as the return (either FCFF or FCFE) whenever one or more of the following conditions is present: The company does not pay dividends. The company pays dividends, but the dividends paid differ significantly from the company’s capacity to pay dividends. Free cash flows align with profitability within a reasonable forecast period with which the analyst is comfortable. The investor takes a “control” perspective. With control comes discretion over the uses of free cash flow. If an investor can take control of the company (or expects another investor to do so), dividends may be changed substantially; for example, they may be set at a level approximating the company’s capacity to pay dividends. Such an investor can also apply free cash flows to uses such as servicing the debt incurred in an acquisition. Common equity can be valued directly by finding the present value of FCFE or indirectly by first using an FCFF model to estimate the value of the firm and then subtracting the value of non-common-stock capital (usually debt) to arrive at an estimate of the value of equity. The purpose of the coverage in the subsequent sections is to develop the background required to use the FCFF or FCFE approaches to value a company’s equity. In the next section, we define the concepts of free cash flow to the firm and free cash flow to equity and then present the two valuation models based on discounting of FCFF and FCFE. We also explore the constant-growth models for valuing FCFF and FCFE, which are special cases of the general models. The subsequent sections turn to the vital task of calculating and forecasting FCFF and FCFE. They also explain multistage free cash flow valuation models and present some of the issues associated with their application. Analysts usually value operating assets and non-operating assets separately and then combine them to find the total value of the firm, an approach described in the last section on this topic.","The member should be able to: compare the free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE) approaches to valuation; explain the ownership perspective implicit in the FCFE approach; explain the appropriate adjustments to net income, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), and cash flow from operations (CFO) to calculate FCFF and FCFE; calculate FCFF and FCFE; describe approaches for forecasting FCFF and FCFE; compare the FCFE model and dividend discount models; explain how dividends, share repurchases, share issues, and changes in leverage may affect future FCFF and FCFE; evaluate the use of net income and EBITDA as proxies for cash flow in valuation; explain the single-stage (stable-growth), two-stage, and three-stage FCFF and FCFE models and select and justify the appropriate model given a company’s characteristics; estimate a company’s value using the appropriate free cash flow model(s); explain the use of sensitivity analysis in FCFF and FCFE valuations; describe approaches for calculating the terminal value in a multistage valuation model; and evaluate whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued based on a free cash flow valuation model.","Discounted cash flow models are widely used by analysts to value companies. Free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE) are the cash flows available to, respectively, all of the investors in the company and to common stockholders. Analysts like to use free cash flow (either FCFF or FCFE) as the return if the company is not paying dividends; if the company pays dividends but the dividends paid differ significantly from the company’s capacity to pay dividends; if free cash flows align with profitability within a reasonable forecast period with which the analyst is comfortable; or if the investor takes a control perspective. The FCFF valuation approach estimates the value of the firm as the present value of future FCFF discounted at the weighted average cost of capital: Firm value = ∑ t = 1 ∞ FCFF t ( 1 + WACC ) t . The value of equity is the value of the firm minus the value of the firm’s debt: Equity value = Firm value – Market value of debt. Dividing the total value of equity by the number of outstanding shares gives the value per share. The WACC formula is WACC = MV ( Debt ) MV ( Debt ) + MV ( Equity ) r d ( 1 − Tax rate ) + MV(Equity) MV ( Debt ) + MV ( Equity ) r . The value of the firm if FCFF is growing at a constant rate is Firm value = FCFF 1 WACC − g = FCFF 0 ( 1 + g ) WACC − g . With the FCFE valuation approach, the value of equity can be found by discounting FCFE at the required rate of return on equity, r : Equity value = ∑ t = 1 ∞ FCFE t ( 1 + r ) t . Dividing the total value of equity by the number of outstanding shares gives the value per share. The value of equity if FCFE is growing at a constant rate is Equity value = FCFE 1 r − g = FCFE 0 ( 1 + g ) r − g . FCFF and FCFE are frequently calculated by starting with net income: FCFF = NI + NCC + Int(1 – Tax rate) – FCInv – WCInv. FCFE = NI + NCC – FCInv – WCInv + Net borrowing. FCFF and FCFE are related to each other as follows: FCFE = FCFF – Int(1 – Tax rate) + Net borrowing. FCFF and FCFE can be calculated by starting from cash flow from operations: FCFF = CFO + Int(1 – Tax rate) – FCInv. FCFE = CFO – FCInv + Net borrowing. FCFF can also be calculated from EBIT or EBITDA: FCFF = EBIT(1 – Tax rate) + Dep – FCInv – WCInv. FCFF = EBITDA(1 – Tax rate) + Dep(Tax rate) – FCInv – WCInv. FCFE can then be found by using FCFE = FCFF – Int(1 – Tax rate) + Net borrowing. Finding CFO, FCFF, and FCFE may require careful interpretation of corporate financial statements. In some cases, the necessary information may not be transparent. Earnings components such as net income, EBIT, EBITDA, and CFO should not be used as cash flow measures to value a firm. These earnings components either double-count or ignore parts of the cash flow stream. FCFF or FCFE valuation expressions can be easily adapted to accommodate complicated capital structures, such as those that include preferred stock. A general expression for the two-stage FCFF valuation model is Firm value = ∑ t = 1 n FCFF t ( 1 + WACC ) t + FCFF n + 1 ( WACC − g ) 1 ( 1 + WACC ) n . A general expression for the two-stage FCFE valuation model is Equity value = ∑ t = 1 n FCFE t ( 1 + r ) t + ( FCFE n + 1 r − g ) [ 1 ( 1 + r ) n ] . One common two-stage model assumes a constant growth rate in each stage, and a second common model assumes declining growth in Stage 1 followed by a long-run sustainable growth rate in Stage 2. To forecast FCFF and FCFE, analysts build a variety of models of varying complexity. A common approach is to forecast sales, with profitability, investments, and financing derived from changes in sales. Three-stage models are often considered to be good approximations for cash flow streams that, in reality, fluctuate from year to year. Non-operating assets, such as excess cash and marketable securities, noncurrent investment securities, and nonperforming assets, are usually segregated from the company’s operating assets. They are valued separately and then added to the value of the company’s operating assets to find total firm value.

Companies and governments raise capital in the debt market to fund current operations; buy equipment; build factories, roads, bridges, airports, and hospitals; acquire assets; and so on. By channeling savings into productive investments, the debt markets facilitate economic growth. Credit analysis has a crucial function in the debt capital markets—efficiently allocating capital by properly assessing credit risk, pricing it accordingly, and repricing it as risks change. How do fixed-income investors determine the riskiness of that debt, and how do they decide what they need to earn as compensation for that risk? In the sections that follow, we cover basic principles of credit analysis, which may be broadly defined as the process by which credit risk is evaluated. Readers will be introduced to the definition of credit risk, the interpretation of credit ratings, the four Cs of traditional credit analysis, and key financial measures and ratios used in credit analysis. We explain, among other things, how to compare bond issuer creditworthiness within a given industry as well as across industries and how credit risk is priced in the bond market. Our coverage focuses primarily on analysis of corporate debt; however, credit analysis of sovereign and nonsovereign, particularly municipal, government bonds will also be addressed. Structured finance, a segment of the debt markets that includes securities backed by such pools of assets as residential and commercial mortgages as well as other consumer loans, will not be covered here. We first introduce the key components of credit risk—default probability and loss severity— along with such credit-related risks as spread risk, credit migration risk, and liquidity risk. We then discuss the relationship between credit risk and the capital structure of the firm before turning attention to the role of credit rating agencies. We also explore the process of analyzing the credit risk of corporations and examine the impact of credit spreads on risk and return. Finally, we look at special considerations applicable to the analysis of (i) high-yield (low-quality) corporate bonds and (ii) government bonds.","The member should be able to: describe credit risk and credit-related risks affecting corporate bonds;<list-type>los</list-type> describe default probability and loss severity as components of credit risk; describe seniority rankings of corporate debt and explain the potential violation of the priority of claims in a bankruptcy proceeding; compare and contrast corporate issuer credit ratings and issue credit ratings and describe the rating agency practice of “notching”; explain risks in relying on ratings from credit rating agencies; explain the four Cs (Capacity, Collateral, Covenants, and Character) of traditional credit analysis; calculate and interpret financial ratios used in credit analysis; evaluate the credit quality of a corporate bond issuer and a bond of that issuer, given key financial ratios of the issuer and the industry; describe macroeconomic, market, and issuer-specific factors that influence the level and volatility of yield spreads; explain special considerations when evaluating the credit of high-yield, sovereign, and non-sovereign government debt issuers and issues.","In this reading, we introduced readers to the basic principles of credit analysis. We described the importance of the credit markets and credit and credit-related risks. We discussed the role and importance of credit ratings and the methodology associated with assigning ratings, as well as the risks of relying on credit ratings. The reading covered the key components of credit analysis and the financial measure used to help assess creditworthiness. We also discussed risk versus return when investing in credit and how spread changes affect holding period returns. In addition, we addressed the special considerations to take into account when doing credit analysis of high-yield companies, sovereign borrowers, and non-sovereign government bonds. Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the borrower failing to make full and timely payments of interest and/or principal. The key components of credit risk are risk of default and loss severity in the event of default. The product of the two is expected loss. Investors in higher-quality bonds tend not to focus on loss severity because default risk for those securities is low. Loss severity equals (1 – Recovery rate). Credit-related risks include downgrade risk (also called credit migration risk) and market liquidity risk. Either of these can cause yield spreads—yield premiums—to rise and bond prices to fall. Downgrade risk refers to a decline in an issuer’s creditworthiness. Downgrades will cause its bonds to trade with wider yield spreads and thus lower prices. Market liquidity risk refers to a widening of the bid–ask spread on an issuer’s bonds. Lower-quality bonds tend to have greater market liquidity risk than higher-quality bonds, and during times of market or financial stress, market liquidity risk rises. The composition of an issuer’s debt and equity is referred to as its “capital structure.” Debt ranks ahead of all types of equity with respect to priority of payment, and within the debt component of the capital structure, there can be varying levels of seniority. With respect to priority of claims, secured debt ranks ahead of unsecured debt, and within unsecured debt, senior debt ranks ahead of subordinated debt. In the typical case, all of an issuer’s bonds have the same probability of default due to cross-default provisions in most indentures. Higher priority of claim implies higher recovery rate—lower loss severity—in the event of default. For issuers with more complex corporate structures—for example, a parent holding company that has operating subsidiaries—debt at the holding company is structurally subordinated to the subsidiary debt, although the possibility of more diverse assets and earnings streams from other sources could still result in the parent having higher effective credit quality than a particular subsidiary. Recovery rates can vary greatly by issuer and industry. They are influenced by the composition of an issuer’s capital structure, where in the economic and credit cycle the default occurred, and what the market’s view of the future prospects are for the issuer and its industry. The priority of claims in bankruptcy is not always absolute. It can be influenced by several factors, including some leeway accorded to bankruptcy judges, government involvement, or a desire on the part of the more senior creditors to settle with the more junior creditors and allow the issuer to emerge from bankruptcy as a going concern, rather than risking smaller and delayed recovery in the event of a liquidation of the borrower. Credit rating agencies, such as Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, and Fitch, play a central role in the credit markets. Nearly every bond issued in the broad debt markets carries credit ratings, which are opinions about a bond issue’s creditworthiness. Credit ratings enable investors to compare the credit risk of debt issues and issuers within a given industry, across industries, and across geographic markets. Bonds rated Aaa to Baa3 by Moody’s and AAA to BBB– by Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and/or Fitch (higher to lower) are referred to as “investment grade.” Bonds rated lower than that—Ba1 or lower by Moody’s and BB+ or lower by S&P and/or Fitch—are referred to as “below investment grade” or “speculative grade.” Below-investment-grade bonds are also called “high-yield” or “junk” bonds. The rating agencies rate both issuers and issues. Issuer ratings are meant to address an issuer’s overall creditworthiness—its risk of default. Ratings for issues incorporate such factors as their rankings in the capital structure. The rating agencies will notch issue ratings up or down to account for such factors as capital structure ranking for secured or subordinated bonds, reflecting different recovery rates in the event of default. Ratings may also be notched due to structural subordination. There are risks in relying too much on credit agency ratings. Creditworthiness may change over time, and initial/current ratings do not necessarily reflect the creditworthiness of an issuer or bond over an investor’s holding period. Valuations often adjust before ratings change, and the notching process may not adequately reflect the price decline of a bond that is lower ranked in the capital structure. Because ratings primarily reflect the probability of default but not necessarily the severity of loss given default, bonds with the same rating may have significantly different expected losses (default probability times loss severity). And like analysts, credit rating agencies may have difficulty forecasting certain credit-negative outcomes, such as adverse litigation, leveraging corporate transactions, and such low probability/high severity events as earthquakes and hurricanes. The role of corporate credit analysis is to assess the company’s ability to make timely payments of interest and to repay principal at maturity. Credit analysis is similar to equity analysis. It is important to understand, however, that bonds are contracts and that management’s duty to bondholders and other creditors is limited to the terms of the contract. In contrast, management’s duty to shareholders is to act in their best interest by trying to maximize the value of the company—perhaps even at the expense of bondholders at times. Credit analysts tend to focus more on the downside risk given the asymmetry of risk/return, whereas equity analysts focus more on upside opportunity from earnings growth, and so on. The “4 Cs” of credit—capacity, collateral, covenants, and character—provide a useful framework for evaluating credit risk. Credit analysis focuses on an issuer’s ability to generate cash flow. The analysis starts with an industry assessment—structure and fundamentals—and continues with an analysis of an issuer’s competitive position, management strategy, and track record. Credit measures are used to calculate an issuer’s creditworthiness, as well as to compare its credit quality with peer companies. Key credit ratios focus on leverage and interest coverage and use such measures as EBITDA, free cash flow, funds from operations, interest expense and balance sheet debt. An issuer’s ability to access liquidity is also an important consideration in credit analysis. The higher the credit risk, the greater the offered/required yield and potential return demanded by investors. Over time, bonds with more credit risk offer higher returns but with greater volatility of return than bonds with lower credit risk. The yield on a credit-risky bond comprises the yield on a default risk–free bond with a comparable maturity plus a yield premium, or “spread,” that comprises a credit spread and a liquidity premium. That spread is intended to compensate investors for credit risk—risk of default and loss severity in the event of default—and the credit-related risks that can cause spreads to widen and prices to decline—downgrade or credit migration risk and market liquidity risk. Yield spread = Liquidity premium + Credit spread. In times of financial market stress, the liquidity premium can increase sharply, causing spreads to widen on all credit-risky bonds, with lower-quality issuers most affected. In times of credit improvement or stability, however, credit spreads can narrow sharply as well, providing attractive investment returns. Credit curves—the plot of yield spreads for a given bond issuer across the yield curve—are typically upward sloping, with the exception of high premium-priced bonds and distressed bonds, where credit curves can be inverted because of the fear of default, when all creditors at a given ranking in the capital structure will receive the same recovery rate without regard to debt maturity. The impact of spread changes on holding period returns for credit-risky bonds are a product of two primary factors: the basis point spread change and the sensitivity of price to yield as reflected by (end-of-period) modified duration and convexity. Spread narrowing enhances holding period returns, whereas spread widening has a negative impact on holding period returns. Longer-duration bonds have greater price and return sensitivity to changes in spread than shorter-duration bonds. Price impact ≈ –(MDur × ∆Spread) + ½Cvx × (∆Spread) 2 For high-yield bonds, with their greater risk of default, more emphasis should be placed on an issuer’s sources of liquidity, as well as on its debt structure and corporate structure. Credit risk can vary greatly across an issuer’s debt structure depending on the seniority ranking. Many high-yield companies have complex capital structures, resulting in different levels of credit risk depending on where the debt resides. Covenant analysis is especially important for high-yield bonds. Key covenants include payment restrictions, limitation on liens, change of control, coverage maintenance tests (often limited to bank loans), and any guarantees from restricted subsidiaries. Covenant language can be very technical and legalistic, so it may help to seek legal or expert assistance. An equity-like approach to high-yield analysis can be helpful. Calculating and comparing enterprise value with EBITDA and debt/EBITDA can show a level of equity “cushion” or support beneath an issuer’s debt. Sovereign credit analysis includes assessing both an issuer’s ability and willingness to pay its debt obligations. Willingness to pay is important because, due to sovereign immunity, a sovereign government cannot be forced to pay its debts. In assessing sovereign credit risk, a helpful framework is to focus on five broad areas: (1) institutional effectiveness and political risks, (2) economic structure and growth prospects, (3) external liquidity and international investment position, (4) fiscal performance, flexibility, and debt burden, and (5) monetary flexibility. Among the characteristics of a high-quality sovereign credit are the absence of corruption and/or challenges to political framework; governmental checks and balances; respect for rule of law and property rights; commitment to honor debts; high per capita income with stable, broad-based growth prospects; control of a reserve or actively traded currency; currency flexibility; low foreign debt and foreign financing needs relative to receipts in foreign currencies; stable or declining ratio of debt to GDP; low debt service as a percent of revenue; low ratio of net debt to GDP; operationally independent central bank; track record of low and stable inflation; and a well-developed banking system and active money market. Non-sovereign or local government bonds, including municipal bonds, are typically either general obligation bonds or revenue bonds. General obligation (GO) bonds are backed by the taxing authority of the issuing non-sovereign government. The credit analysis of GO bonds has some similarities to sovereign analysis—debt burden per capita versus income per capita, tax burden, demographics, and economic diversity. Underfunded and “off-balance-sheet” liabilities, such as pensions for public employees and retirees, are debt-like in nature. Revenue-backed bonds support specific projects, such as toll roads, bridges, airports, and other infrastructure. The creditworthiness comes from the revenues generated by usage fees and tolls levied.

This reading focuses on the context within which these standards are created. An understanding of the underlying framework of financial reporting standards, which is broader than knowledge of specific accounting rules, will allow an analyst to assess the valuation implications of financial statement elements and transactions—including transactions, such as those that represent new developments, which are not specifically addressed by the standards. Section 2 of this reading discusses the objective of financial reporting and the importance of financial reporting standards in security analysis and valuation. Section 3 describes the roles of financial reporting standard-setting bodies and regulatory authorities and several of the financial reporting standard-setting bodies and regulatory authorities. Section 4 describes the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) framework and general requirements for financial statements. Section 5 compares IFRS and alternative reporting systems, and Section 6 discusses the importance of monitoring developments in financial reporting standards. A summary of the key points concludes the reading.","The member should be able to: describe the objective of financial reporting and the importance of financial reporting standards in security analysis and valuation; describe the roles of financial reporting standard-setting bodies and regulatory authorities in establishing and enforcing reporting standards; describe the International Accounting Standards Board’s conceptual framework, including qualitative characteristics of financial reports, constraints on financial reports, and required reporting elements; describe general requirements for financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS); describe implications for financial analysis of alternative financial reporting systems and the importance of monitoring developments in financial reporting standards.","An awareness of financial reporting and underlying financial reporting standards can assist in security valuation and other financial analysis. This reading describes the conceptual objectives of financial reporting standards, the parties involved in standard-setting processes, and the implication for analysts in monitoring developments in reporting standards. Some key points of the reading are summarized below: The objective of financial reporting is to provide financial information about the reporting entity that is useful to existing and potential investors, lenders, and other creditors in making decisions about providing resources to the entity. Financial reporting requires policy choices and estimates. These choices and estimates require judgment, which can vary from one preparer to the next. Accordingly, standards are needed to ensure increased consistency in these judgments. Private sector standard setting bodies and regulatory authorities play significant but different roles in the standard setting process. In general, standard setting bodies make the rules, and regulatory authorities enforce the rules. However, regulators typically retain legal authority to establish financial reporting standards in their jurisdiction. The IFRS framework sets forth the concepts that underlie the preparation and presentation of financial statements for external users. The objective of fair presentation of useful information is the center of the IASB’s Conceptual Framework . The qualitative characteristics of useful information include fundamental and enhancing characteristics. Information must exhibit the fundamental characteristics of relevance and faithful representation to be useful. The enhancing characteristics identified are comparability, verifiability, timeliness, and understandability. IFRS Financial Statements : IAS No. 1 prescribes that a complete set of financial statements includes a statement of financial position (balance sheet), a statement of comprehensive income (either two statements—one for net income and one for comprehensive income—or a single statement combining both net income and comprehensive income), a statement of changes in equity, a cash flow statement, and notes. The notes include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. Financial statements need to reflect certain basic features: fair presentation, going concern, accrual basis, materiality and aggregation, and no offsetting. Financial statements must be prepared at least annually, must include comparative information from the previous period, and must be consistent. Financial statements must follow certain presentation requirements including a classified statement of financial position (balance sheet) and minimum information on both the face of the financial statements and in the notes. A significant number of the world’s listed companies report under either IFRS or US GAAP. In many cases, a user of financial statements will lack the information necessary to make specific adjustments required to achieve comparability between companies that use IFRS and companies that use US GAAP. Instead, an analyst must maintain general caution in interpreting comparative financial measures produced under different accounting standards and monitor significant developments in financial reporting standards. Analysts can remain aware of ongoing developments in financial reporting by monitoring new products or types of transactions; actions of standard setters, regulators, and other groups; and company disclosures regarding critical accounting policies and estimates.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level1a/RR_2024_L1V3R7_market_efficiency.pdf,Equity Investments,2024,Level I,"Market efficiency concerns the extent to which market prices incorporate available information. If market prices do not fully incorporate information, then opportunities may exist to make a profit from the gathering and processing of information. The subject of market efficiency is, therefore, of great interest to investment managers, as illustrated in Example 1. Example 1 Market Efficiency and Active Manager Selection The chief investment officer (CIO) of a major university endowment fund has listed eight steps in the active manager selection process that can be applied both to traditional investments (e.g., common equity and fixed-income securities) and to alternative investments (e.g., private equity, hedge funds, and real assets). The first step specified is the evaluation of market opportunity: What is the opportunity and why is it there? To answer this question, we start by studying capital markets and the types of managers operating within those markets. We identify market inefficiencies and try to understand their causes, such as regulatory structures or behavioral biases. We can rule out many broad groups of managers and strategies by simply determining that the degree of market inefficiency necessary to support a strategy is implausible. Importantly, we consider the past history of active returns meaningless unless we understand why markets will allow those active returns to continue into the future. The CIO’s description underscores the importance of not assuming that past active returns that might be found in a historical dataset will repeat themselves in the future. refer to returns earned by strategies that do not assume that all information is fully reflected in market prices. Governments and market regulators also care about the extent to which market prices incorporate information. Efficient markets imply informative prices—prices that accurately reflect available information about fundamental values. In market-based economies, market prices help determine which companies (and which projects) obtain capital. If these prices do not efficiently incorporate information about a company’s prospects, then it is possible that funds will be misdirected. By contrast, prices that are informative help direct scarce resources and funds available for investment to their highest-valued uses. Informative prices thus promote economic growth. The efficiency of a country’s capital markets (in which businesses raise financing) is an important characteristic of a well-functioning financial system. The remainder of this reading is organized as follows. Section 2 provides specifics on how the efficiency of an asset market is described and discusses the factors affecting (i.e., contributing to and impeding) market efficiency. Section 3 presents an influential three-way classification of the efficiency of security markets and discusses its implications for fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and portfolio management. Section 4 presents several market anomalies (apparent market inefficiencies that have received enough attention to be individually identified and named) and describes how these anomalies relate to investment strategies. Section 5 introduces behavioral finance and how that field of study relates to market efficiency. A summary concludes the reading.","The member should be able to: The candidate should be able to: describe market efficiency and related concepts, including their importance to investment practitioners; distinguish between market value and intrinsic value; explain factors that affect a market’s efficiency; contrast weak-form, semi-strong-form, and strong-form market efficiency; explain the implications of each form of market efficiency for fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and the choice between active and passive portfolio management; describe market anomalies; describe behavioral finance and its potential relevance to understanding market anomalies.","This reading has provided an overview of the theory and evidence regarding market efficiency and has discussed the different forms of market efficiency as well as the implications for fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and portfolio management. The general conclusion drawn from the efficient market hypothesis is that it is not possible to beat the market on a consistent basis by generating returns in excess of those expected for the level of risk of the investment. Additional key points include the following: The efficiency of a market is affected by the number of market participants and depth of analyst coverage, information availability, and limits to trading. There are three forms of efficient markets, each based on what is considered to be the information used in determining asset prices. In the weak form, asset prices fully reflect all market data, which refers to all past price and trading volume information. In the semi-strong form, asset prices reflect all publicly known and available information. In the strong form, asset prices fully reflect all information, which includes both public and private information. Intrinsic value refers to the true value of an asset, whereas market value refers to the price at which an asset can be bought or sold. When markets are efficient, the two should be the same or very close. But when markets are not efficient, the two can diverge significantly. Most empirical evidence supports the idea that securities markets in developed countries are semi-strong-form efficient; however, empirical evidence does not support the strong form of the efficient market hypothesis. A number of anomalies have been documented that contradict the notion of market efficiency, including the size anomaly, the January anomaly, and the winners–losers anomalies. In most cases, however, contradictory evidence both supports and refutes the anomaly. Behavioral finance uses human psychology, such as behavioral biases, in an attempt to explain investment decisions. Whereas behavioral finance is helpful in understanding observed decisions, a market can still be considered efficient even if market participants exhibit seemingly irrational behaviors, such as herding.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V4R13-introduction-asset-backed-securities.pdf,Fixed Income,2023,Level I,"Previous readings examined the risk characteristics of various fixed-income instruments and the relationships between maturity, coupon, and interest rate changes. This reading introduces fixed-income instruments created through a process known as securitization. The securitization process transfers ownership of assets such as loans or receivables from the original owners into a special legal entity. The special legal entity then issues securities, using the asset cash flows to pay interest and repay the principal to investors. These securities are referred to generically as asset-backed securities (ABS), and the pool of assets from which their cash flows are generated is called collateral or securitized assets. These loans and receivables typically include residential mortgage loans (mortgages), commercial mortgages, automobile (auto) loans, student loans, bank loans, accounts receivable, or credit card receivables. While the ABS market in the United States remains the largest in the world, securitization has recently expanded in both Asia and Europe as well as to other income-yielding assets, such as airport landing slots, toll roads, and cell tower leases. The growing depth and breadth of the global ABS market underscores the importance of a solid understanding of securitization among issuers, investors, and financial analysts. This reading describes the securitization process, discusses its benefits for both issuers and investors, and explains the investment characteristics of different types of ABS. Although investors can invest in some loan types via private credit funds or through secondary markets, securitization creates a more direct link between investors and borrowers for many types of loans and receivables. The terminology regarding ABS varies by jurisdiction. Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are ABS backed by a pool of mortgages, and a distinction is sometimes made between MBS and ABS backed by non-mortgage assets. This distinction is common in the United States, for example, where typically the term “mortgage-backed securities” refers to securities backed by high-quality real estate mortgages and the term “asset-backed securities” refers to securities backed by other types of assets. Covered bonds date back to 18th century Europe and are similar to ABS, but they offer investors recourse to both the issuing financial institution and an underlying asset pool. To underline the importance of securitization from a macroeconomic perspective, we discuss the benefits of securitization for economies and financial markets. Then, we describe the structure of a securitization, identifying the parties involved and their roles as well as typical structures. We further discuss securities backed by mortgages for real estate property, including residential MBS and commercial MBS, and review two common types of non-mortgage ABS—namely, those for auto loans and credit card receivables. The reading concludes with a description of collateralized debt obligations and covered bonds. Benefits of Securitization for Economies and Financial Markets The securitization of pools of loans and receivables into multiple securities provides economies and financial markets with several benefits. Home or auto purchases have been traditionally financed by loans originated by financial institutions, such as commercial banks. For investors to gain exposure to these relatively illiquid loans, they must hold some combination of deposits, debt, or common equity issued by banks. This situation creates an additional intermediary (that is, the bank) between the borrowers and the investors. In addition, by being constrained to hold bank deposits and securities, investors cannot gain direct exposure to loans but are also affected by economic risks undertaken in other bank activities. Securitization solves a number of these problems. It allows investors to achieve more direct legal claims on loan and receivables portfolios, enabling them to tailor interest rate and credit risk exposures to suit their specific needs. Disintermediation (that is, lessening the role of intermediaries) can effectively reduce borrower costs and enhance risk-adjusted investor returns. At the same time, banks can separate loan origination from financing, improving their profitability via origination fees and reducing capital requirements for loans that are sold. Securitization enables banks to expand lending origination beyond their balance sheets, ultimately benefiting individuals, governments, and companies that need to borrow. Securitization also benefits investors by creating access to securities with profiles that match their risk, return, and maturity needs that are otherwise not directly available. For example, a pension fund with a long-term horizon can gain access to long-term real estate loans by investing in residential MBS without having to invest in bank bonds or stocks. Although few institutional or individual investors are willing to make or purchase real estate loans, auto loans, or credit card receivables directly, they may invest in a security backed by such loans or receivables. The ABS that are created by pooling these loans and receivables have characteristics similar to those of a standard bond and do not require the specialized resources and expertise needed to originate, monitor, and collect the payments from the underlying loans and receivables. As a result, investors can increase exposure to the risk–return characteristics of a wider range of underlying assets. Note that in many countries, the sale of ABS and similar instruments is restricted to investors who meet certain qualifications, such as those pertaining to net worth. Securitization allows for the creation of tradable securities with better liquidity than that of the original loans on the bank’s balance sheet. In making loans and receivables tradable, securitization makes financial markets more efficient. It also improves liquidity, which reduces liquidity risk in the financial system, as described later. An important benefit of securitization for companies is that ABS provide an alternative means of funding operations that can be considered alongside bond, preferred equity, and common equity issuance. Companies that originate loans and receivables that can be securitized often compare and optimize the funding costs associated with each source of financing. As we will see, securitization is often less costly than a corporate bond issue secured by the same collateral. For these reasons, securitization is beneficial to economies and financial markets and has been embraced by many sovereign governments. For example, the Italian government has used securitization since the late 1990s for privatizing public assets. In emerging markets, securitization is widely used. For example, in South America, companies and banks with high credit ratings have used securitization to sell receivables on exports, such as oil, to lower their funding costs. Although securitization brings many benefits to economies, it is not without risks, and some of these risks are widely attributed to have precipitated the turmoil in financial markets during 2007–2009. Broadly, those risks fall into two categories: risks that relate primarily to the timing of the ABS’s cash flows, such as contraction risk and extension risk, and risks related to the inherent credit risk of the loans and receivables backing the ABS. This reading describes these risks and discusses some of the structures used to mitigate them as well as redistribute them.","The member should be able to: explain benefits of securitization for economies and financial markets; describe securitization, including the parties involved in the process and the roles they play; describe typical structures of securitizations, including credit tranching and time tranching; describe types and characteristics of residential mortgage loans that are typically securitized; describe types and characteristics of residential mortgage-backed securities, including mortgage pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, and explain the cash flows and risks for each type; define prepayment risk and describe the prepayment risk of mortgage-backed securities; describe characteristics and risks of commercial mortgage-backed securities; describe types and characteristics of non-mortgage asset-backed securities, including the cash flows and risks of each type; describe collateralized debt obligations, including their cash flows and risks; describe characteristics and risks of covered bonds and how they differ from other asset-backed securities.","Securitization involves pooling debt obligations, such as loans or receivables, and creating securities backed by the pool of debt obligations called asset-backed securities (ABS). The cash flows of the debt obligations are used to make interest payments and principal repayments to the holders of the ABS. Securitization has several benefits. It allows investors direct access to liquid investments and payment streams that would be unattainable if all the financing were performed through banks. It enables banks to increase loan originations at economic scales greater than if they used only their own in-house loan portfolios. Thus, securitization contributes to lower costs of borrowing for entities raising funds, higher risk-adjusted returns to investors, and greater efficiency and profitability for the banking sector. The parties to a securitization include the seller of the collateral (pool of loans), the servicer of the loans, and the special purpose entity (SPE). The SPE is bankruptcy remote, which plays a pivotal role in the securitization. A common structure in a securitization is subordination, which leads to the creation of more than one bond class or tranche. Bond classes differ as to how they will share any losses resulting from defaults of the borrowers whose loans are in the collateral. The credit ratings assigned to the various bond classes depend on how the credit-rating agencies evaluate the credit risks of the collateral and any credit enhancements. The motivation for the creation of different types of structures is to redistribute prepayment risk and credit risk efficiently among different bond classes in the securitization. Prepayment risk is the uncertainty that the actual cash flows will be different from the scheduled cash flows as set forth in the loan agreements because borrowers may choose to repay the principal early to take advantage of interest rate movements. Because of the SPE, the securitization of a company’s assets may include some bond classes that have better credit ratings than the company itself or its corporate bonds. Thus, the company’s funding cost is often lower when raising funds through securitization than when issuing corporate bonds. A mortgage is a loan secured by the collateral of some specified real estate property that obliges the borrower to make a predetermined series of payments to the lender. The cash flow of a mortgage includes (1) interest, (2) scheduled principal payments, and (3) prepayments (any principal repaid in excess of the scheduled principal payment). The various mortgage designs throughout the world specify (1) the maturity of the loan; (2) how the interest rate is determined (i.e., fixed rate versus adjustable or variable rate); (3) how the principal is repaid (i.e., whether the loan is amortizing and if it is, whether it is fully amortizing or partially amortizing with a balloon payment); (4) whether the borrower has the option to prepay and if so, whether any prepayment penalties might be imposed; and (5) the rights of the lender in a foreclosure (i.e., whether the loan is a recourse or non-recourse loan). In the United States, there are three sectors for securities backed by residential mortgages: (1) those guaranteed by a federal agency (Ginnie Mae) whose securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the US government, (2) those guaranteed by a GSE (e.g., Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) but not by the US government, and (3) those issued by private entities that are not guaranteed by a federal agency or a GSE. The first two sectors are referred to as agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), and the third sector, as non-agency RMBS. A mortgage pass-through security is created when one or more holders of mortgages form a pool of mortgages and sell shares or participation certificates in the pool. The cash flow of a mortgage pass-through security depends on the cash flow of the underlying pool of mortgages and consists of monthly mortgage payments representing interest, the scheduled repayment of principal, and any prepayments, net of servicing and other administrative fees. Market participants measure the prepayment rate using two measures: the single monthly mortality rate (SMM) and its corresponding annualized rate—namely, the conditional prepayment rate (CPR). For MBS, a measure widely used by market participants to assess effective duration is the weighted average life or simply the average life of the MBS. Market participants use the Public Securities Association (PSA) prepayment benchmark to describe prepayment rates. A PSA assumption greater than 100 PSA means that prepayments are assumed to occur faster than the benchmark, whereas a PSA assumption lower than 100 PSA means that prepayments are assumed to occur slower than the benchmark. Prepayment risk includes two components: contraction risk and extension risk. The former is the risk that when interest rates decline, the security will have a shorter maturity than was anticipated at the time of purchase because homeowners will refinance at the new, lower interest rates. The latter is the risk that when interest rates rise, fewer prepayments will occur than what was anticipated at the time of purchase because homeowners are reluctant to give up the benefits of a contractual interest rate that now looks low. The creation of a collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) can help manage prepayment risk by distributing the various forms of prepayment risk among different classes of bondholders. The CMO’s major financial innovation is that the securities created more closely satisfy the asset/liability needs of institutional investors, thereby broadening the appeal of mortgage-backed products. The most common types of CMO tranche are sequential-pay tranches, planned amortization class (PAC) tranches, support tranches, and floating-rate tranches. Non-agency RMBS share many features and structuring techniques with agency CMOs. However, they typically include two complementary mechanisms. First, the cash flows are distributed by rules that dictate the allocation of interest payments and principal repayments to tranches with various degrees of priority/seniority. Second, there are rules for the allocation of realized losses that specify that subordinated bond classes have lower payment priority than senior classes. In order to obtain favorable credit ratings, non-agency RMBS and non-mortgage ABS often require one or more credit enhancements. The most common forms of internal credit enhancement are senior/subordinated structures, reserve funds, and overcollateralization. In external credit enhancement, credit support in the case of defaults resulting in losses in the pool of loans is provided in the form of a financial guarantee by a third party to the transaction. Commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) are securities backed by a pool of commercial mortgages on income-producing property. Two key indicators of the potential credit performance of CMBS are the debt-service-coverage (DSC) ratio and the loan-to-value ratio (LTV). The DSC ratio is the property’s annual net operating income divided by the debt service. CMBS have considerable call protection, which allows CMBS to trade in the market more like corporate bonds than like RMBS. This call protection comes in two forms: at the structure level and at the loan level. The creation of sequential-pay tranches is an example of call protection at the structure level. At the loan level, four mechanisms offer investors call protection: prepayment lockouts, prepayment penalty points, yield maintenance charges, and defeasance. ABS are backed by a wide range of asset types. The most popular non-mortgage ABS are auto loan ABS and credit card receivable ABS. The collateral is amortizing for auto loan ABS and non-amortizing for credit card receivable ABS. As with non-agency RMBS, these ABS must offer credit enhancement to be appealing to investors. A collateralized debt obligation (CDO) is a generic term used to describe a security backed by a diversified pool of one or more debt obligations (e.g., corporate and emerging market bonds, leveraged bank loans, ABS, RMBS, and CMBS). A CDO involves the creation of an SPE. The funds necessary to pay the bond classes come from a pool of loans that must be serviced. A CDO requires a collateral manager to buy and sell debt obligations for and from the CDO’s portfolio of assets to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the obligations of the CDO bondholders and to generate a fair return for the equityholders. The structure of a CDO includes senior, mezzanine, and subordinated/equity bond classes. Covered bonds are similar to ABS, but they differ because of their dual recourse nature, strict eligibility criteria, dynamic cover pool, and redemption regimes in the event of sponsor default.

With the rise of big data and machine learning techniques, investment practitioners are embracing an era featuring large volume, high velocity, and a wide variety of data. This Refresher Reading invites you to explore and exploit this abundance of information for your investment strategies. While this data-rich environment offers potentially tremendous opportunities for investors, turning data into useful information is not so straightforward. Organizing, cleaning, and analyzing data are crucial to the development of successful investment strategies; otherwise, we end up with “garbage in and garbage out” and failed investments. It is often said that 80% of an analyst’s time is spent on finding, organizing, cleaning, and analyzing data, while just 20% of her/his time is taken up by model development. So, the importance of having a properly organized, cleansed, and well-analyzed dataset cannot be over-emphasized. With this essential requirement met, an appropriately executed data analysis can detect important relationships within data, uncover underlying structures, identify outliers, and extract potentially valuable insights. Utilizing both visual tools and quantitative methods, like the ones covered in this reading, is the first step in summarizing and understanding data that will be crucial inputs to an investment strategy. This reading provides a foundation for understanding important concepts that are an indispensable part of the analytical tool kit needed by investment practitioners, from junior analysts to senior portfolio managers. These basic concepts pave the way for more sophisticated tools that will be developed as the quantitative methods topic unfolds and that are integral to gaining competencies in the investment management techniques and asset classes that are presented later in the CFA curriculum. Section 2 covers core data types, including continuous and discrete numerical data, nominal and ordinal categorical data, and structured versus unstructured data. Organizing data into arrays and data tables and summarizing data in frequency distributions and contingency tables are discussed in Section 3. Section 4 introduces the important topic of data visualization using a range of charts and graphics to summarize, explore, and better understand data. Section 5 covers the key measures of central tendency, including several variants of mean that are especially useful in investments. Quantiles and their investment applications are the focus of Section 6. Key measures of dispersion are discussed in Section 7. The shape of data distributions—specifically, skewness and kurtosis—are covered in Sections 8 and 9, respectively. Section 10 provides a graphical introduction to covariance and correlation between two variables. The reading concludes with a Summary.",The member should be able to: Identify and compare data types; Describe how data are organized for quantitative analysis; Interpret frequency and related distributions; Interpret a contingency table; Describe ways that data may be visualized and evaluate uses of specific visualizations; Describe how to select among visualization types; Calculate and interpret measures of central tendency; Select among alternative definitions of mean to address an investment problem; Calculate quantiles and interpret related visualizations; Calculate and interpret measures of dispersion; Calculate and interpret target downside deviation; Interpret skewness; Interpret kurtosis; Interpret correlation between two variables.,"In this reading, we have presented tools and techniques for organizing, visualizing, and describing data that permit us to convert raw data into useful information for investment analysis. Data can be defined as a collection of numbers, characters, words, and text—as well as images, audio, and video—in a raw or organized format to represent facts or information. From a statistical perspective, data can be classified as numerical data and categorical data. Numerical data (also called quantitative data) are values that represent measured or counted quantities as a number. Categorical data (also called qualitative data) are values that describe a quality or characteristic of a group of observations and usually take only a limited number of values that are mutually exclusive. Numerical data can be further split into two types: continuous data and discrete data. Continuous data can be measured and can take on any numerical value in a specified range of values. Discrete data are numerical values that result from a counting process and therefore are limited to a finite number of values. Categorical data can be further classified into two types: nominal data and ordinal data. Nominal data are categorical values that are not amenable to being organized in a logical order, while ordinal data are categorical values that can be logically ordered or ranked. Based on how they are collected, data can be categorized into three types: cross-sectional, time series, and panel. Time-series data are a sequence of observations for a single observational unit on a specific variable collected over time and at discrete and typically equally spaced intervals of time. Cross-sectional data are a list of the observations of a specific variable from multiple observational units at a given point in time. Panel data are a mix of time-series and cross-sectional data that consists of observations through time on one or more variables for multiple observational units. Based on whether or not data are in a highly organized form, they can be classified into structured and unstructured types. Structured data are highly organized in a pre-defined manner, usually with repeating patterns. Unstructured data do not follow any conventionally organized forms; they are typically alternative data as they are usually collected from unconventional sources. Raw data are typically organized into either a one-dimensional array or a two-dimensional rectangular array (also called a data table) for quantitative analysis. A frequency distribution is a tabular display of data constructed either by counting the observations of a variable by distinct values or groups or by tallying the values of a numerical variable into a set of numerically ordered bins. Frequency distributions permit us to evaluate how data are distributed. The relative frequency of observations in a bin (interval or bucket) is the number of observations in the bin divided by the total number of observations. The cumulative relative frequency cumulates (adds up) the relative frequencies as we move from the first bin to the last, thus giving the fraction of the observations that are less than the upper limit of each bin. A contingency table is a tabular format that displays the frequency distributions of two or more categorical variables simultaneously. One application of contingency tables is for evaluating the performance of a classification model (using a confusion matrix). Another application of contingency tables is to investigate a potential association between two categorical variables by performing a chi-square test of independence. Visualization is the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format for the purpose of increasing understanding and for gaining insights into the data. A histogram is a bar chart of data that have been grouped into a frequency distribution. A frequency polygon is a graph of frequency distributions obtained by drawing straight lines joining successive midpoints of bars representing the class frequencies. A bar chart is used to plot the frequency distribution of categorical data, with each bar representing a distinct category and the bar’s height (or length) proportional to the frequency of the corresponding category. Grouped bar charts or stacked bar charts can present the frequency distribution of multiple categorical variables simultaneously. A tree-map is a graphical tool to display categorical data. It consists of a set of colored rectangles to represent distinct groups, and the area of each rectangle is proportional to the value of the corresponding group. Additional dimensions of categorical data can be displayed by nested rectangles. A word cloud is a visual device for representing textual data, with the size of each distinct word being proportional to the frequency with which it appears in the given text. A line chart is a type of graph used to visualize ordered observations and often to display the change of data series over time. A bubble line chart is a special type of line chart that uses varying-sized bubbles as data points to represent an additional dimension of data. A scatter plot is a type of graph for visualizing the joint variation in two numerical variables. It is constructed by drawing dots to indicate the values of the two variables plotted against the corresponding axes. A scatter plot matrix organizes scatter plots between pairs of variables into a matrix format to inspect all pairwise relationships between more than two variables in one combined visual. A heat map is a type of graphic that organizes and summarizes data in a tabular format and represents it using a color spectrum. It is often used in displaying frequency distributions or visualizing the degree of correlation among different variables. The key consideration when selecting among chart types is the intended purpose of visualizing data (i.e., whether it is for exploring/presenting distributions or relationships or for making comparisons). A population is defined as all members of a specified group. A sample is a subset of a population. A parameter is any descriptive measure of a population. A sample statistic (statistic, for short) is a quantity computed from or used to describe a sample. Sample statistics—such as measures of central tendency, measures of dispersion, skewness, and kurtosis—help with investment analysis, particularly in making probabilistic statements about returns. Measures of central tendency specify where data are centered and include the mean, median, and mode (i.e., the most frequently occurring value). The arithmetic mean is the sum of the observations divided by the number of observations. It is the most frequently used measure of central tendency. The median is the value of the middle item (or the mean of the values of the two middle items) when the items in a set are sorted into ascending or descending order. The median is not influenced by extreme values and is most useful in the case of skewed distributions. The mode is the most frequently observed value and is the only measure of central tendency that can be used with nominal data. A distribution may be unimodal (one mode), bimodal (two modes), trimodal (three modes), or have even more modes. A portfolio’s return is a weighted mean return computed from the returns on the individual assets, where the weight applied to each asset’s return is the fraction of the portfolio invested in that asset. The geometric mean, X ¯ G , of a set of observations X 1 , X 2 , …, X n , is X ¯ G = X 1 X 2 X 3 … X n n , with X i ≥ 0 for i = 1, 2, …, n . The geometric mean is especially important in reporting compound growth rates for time-series data. The geometric mean will always be less than an arithmetic mean whenever there is variance in the observations. The harmonic mean, X ¯ H , is a type of weighted mean in which an observation’s weight is inversely proportional to its magnitude. Quantiles—such as the median, quartiles, quintiles, deciles, and percentiles—are location parameters that divide a distribution into halves, quarters, fifths, tenths, and hundredths, respectively. A box and whiskers plot illustrates the interquartile range (the “box”) as well as a range outside of the box that is based on the interquartile range, indicated by the “whiskers.” Dispersion measures—such as the range, mean absolute deviation (MAD), variance, standard deviation, target downside deviation, and coefficient of variation—describe the variability of outcomes around the arithmetic mean. The range is the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value of the dataset. The range has only a limited usefulness because it uses information from only two observations. The MAD for a sample is the average of the absolute deviations of observations from the mean, ∑ i = 1 n | X i − X ¯ | n , where X ¯ is the sample mean and n is the number of observations in the sample. The variance is the average of the squared deviations around the mean, and the standard deviation is the positive square root of variance. In computing sample variance ( s 2 ) and sample standard deviation ( s ), the average squared deviation is computed using a divisor equal to the sample size minus 1. The target downside deviation, or target semideviation, is a measure of the risk of being below a given target. It is calculated as the square root of the average squared deviations from the target, but it includes only those observations below the target ( B ), or ∑ for all X i ≤ B n ( X i − B ) 2 n − 1 . The coefficient of variation, CV, is the ratio of the standard deviation of a set of observations to their mean value. By expressing the magnitude of variation among observations relative to their average size, the CV permits direct comparisons of dispersion across different datasets. Reflecting the correction for scale, the CV is a scale-free measure (i.e., it has no units of measurement). Skew or skewness describes the degree to which a distribution is asymmetric about its mean. A return distribution with positive skewness has frequent small losses and a few extreme gains compared to a normal distribution. A return distribution with negative skewness has frequent small gains and a few extreme losses compared to a normal distribution. Zero skewness indicates a symmetric distribution of returns. Kurtosis measures the combined weight of the tails of a distribution relative to the rest of the distribution. A distribution with fatter tails than the normal distribution is referred to as fat-tailed (leptokurtic); a distribution with thinner tails than the normal distribution is referred to as thin-tailed (platykurtic). Excess kurtosis is kurtosis minus 3, since 3 is the value of kurtosis for all normal distributions. The correlation coefficient is a statistic that measures the association between two variables. It is the ratio of covariance to the product of the two variables’ standard deviations. A positive correlation coefficient indicates that the two variables tend to move together, whereas a negative coefficient indicates that the two variables tend to move in opposite directions. Correlation does not imply causation, simply association. Issues that arise in evaluating correlation include the presence of outliers and spurious correlation.

Generally, the decisions involve trading securities, currencies, contracts, commodities, and real assets such as real estate. Consider several examples: Fixed income analysts evaluate issuer credit-worthiness and macroeconomic prospects to determine which bonds and notes to buy or sell to preserve capital while obtaining a fair rate of return. Stock analysts study corporate values to determine which stocks to buy or sell to maximize the value of their stock portfolios. Corporate treasurers analyze exchange rates, interest rates, and credit conditions to determine which currencies to trade and which notes to buy or sell to have funds available in a needed currency. Risk managers work for producers or users of commodities to calculate how many commodity futures contracts to buy or sell to manage inventory risks. Financial analysts must understand the characteristics of the markets in which their decisions will be executed. This reading, by examining those markets from the analyst’s perspective, provides that understanding. This reading is organized as follows. Section 2 examines the functions of the financial system. Section 3 introduces assets that investors, information-motivated traders, and risk managers use to advance their financial objectives and presents ways practitioners classify these assets into markets. These assets include such financial instruments as securities, currencies, and some contracts; certain commodities; and real assets. Financial analysts must know the distinctive characteristics of these trading assets. Section 4 is an overview of financial intermediaries (entities that facilitate the functioning of the financial system). Section 5 discusses the positions that can be obtained while trading assets. You will learn about the benefits and risks of long and short positions, how these positions can be financed, and how the financing affects their risks. Section 6 discusses how market participants order trades and how markets process those orders. These processes must be understood to achieve trading objectives while controlling transaction costs. Section 7 focuses on describing primary markets. Section 8 describes the structures of secondary markets in securities. Sections 9 and 10 close the reading with discussions of the characteristics of a well-functioning financial system and of how regulation helps make financial markets function better. A summary reviews the reading’s major ideas and points, and practice problems conclude.","The member should be able to: explain the main functions of the financial system; describe classifications of assets and markets; describe the major types of securities, currencies, contracts, commodities, and real assets that trade in organized markets, including their distinguishing characteristics and major subtypes; describe types of financial intermediaries and services that they provide; compare positions an investor can take in an asset; calculate and interpret the leverage ratio, the rate of return on a margin transaction, and the security price at which the investor would receive a margin call; compare execution, validity, and clearing instructions; compare market orders with limit orders; define primary and secondary markets and explain how secondary markets support primary markets; describe how securities, contracts, and currencies are traded in quote-driven, order-driven, and brokered markets; describe characteristics of a well-functioning financial system; describe objectives of market regulation.","This reading introduces how the financial system operates and explains how well-functioning financial systems lead to wealthy economies. Financial analysts need to understand how the financial system works because their analyses often lead to trading decisions. The financial system consists of markets and the financial intermediaries that operate in them. These institutions allow buyers to connect with sellers. They may trade directly with each other when they trade the same instrument or they only may trade indirectly when a financial intermediary connects the buyer to the seller through transactions with each that appear on the intermediary’s balance sheet. The buyer and seller may exchange instruments, cash flows, or risks. The following points, among others, were made in this reading: The financial system consists of mechanisms that allow strangers to contract with each other to move money through time, to hedge risks, and to exchange assets that they value less for those that they value more. Investors move money from the present to the future when they save. They expect a normal rate of return for bearing risk through time. Borrowers move money from the future to the present to fund current projects and expenditures. Hedgers trade to reduce their exposure to risks they prefer not to take. Information-motivated traders are active investment managers who try to identify under- and overvalued instruments. Securities are first sold in primary markets by their issuers. They then trade in secondary markets. People invest in pooled investment vehicles to benefit from the investment management services of their managers. Forward contracts allow buyers and sellers to arrange for future sales at predetermined prices. Futures contracts are forward contracts guaranteed by clearinghouses. The guarantee ensures that strangers are willing to trade with each other and that traders can offset their positions by trading with anybody. These features of futures contract markets make them highly attractive to hedgers and information-motivated traders. Many financial intermediaries connect buyers to sellers in a given instrument, acting directly as brokers and exchanges or indirectly as dealers and arbitrageurs. Financial intermediaries create instruments when they conduct arbitrage, securitize assets, borrow to lend, manage investment funds, or pool insurance contracts. These activities all transform cash flows and risks from one form to another. Their services allow buyers and sellers to connect with each other through instruments that meet their specific needs. Financial markets work best when strangers can contract with each other without worrying about whether their counterparts are able and willing to honor their contract. Clearinghouses, variation margins, maintenance margins, and settlement guarantees made by creditworthy brokers on behalf of their clients help manage credit risk and ultimately allow strangers to contract with each other. Information-motivated traders short sell when they expect that prices will fall. Hedgers short sell to reduce the risks of a long position in a related contract or commodity. Margin loans allow people to buy more securities than their equity would otherwise permit them to buy. The larger positions expose them to more risk so that gains and losses for a given amount of equity will be larger. The leverage ratio is the value of a position divided by the value of the equity supporting it. The returns to the equity in a position are equal to the leverage ratio times the returns to the unleveraged position. To protect against credit losses, brokers demand maintenance margin payments from their customers who have borrowed cash or securities when adverse price changes cause their customer’s equity to drop below the maintenance margin ratio. Brokers close positions for customers who do not satisfy these margin calls. Orders are instructions to trade. They always specify instrument, side (buy or sell), and quantity. They usually also provide several other instructions. Market orders tend to fill quickly but often at inferior prices. Limit orders generally fill at better prices if they fill, but they may not fill. Traders choose order submission strategies on the basis of how quickly they want to trade, the prices they are willing to accept, and the consequences of failing to trade. Stop instructions are attached to other orders to delay efforts to fill them until the stop condition is satisfied. Although stop orders are often used to stop losses, they are not always effective. Issuers sell their securities using underwritten public offerings, best efforts public offerings, private placements, shelf registrations, dividend reinvestment programs, and rights offerings. Investment banks have a conflict of interests when setting the initial offering price in an IPO. Well-functioning secondary markets are essential to raising capital in the primary markets because investors value the ability to sell their securities if they no longer want to hold them or if they need to disinvest to raise cash. If they cannot trade their securities in a liquid market, they will not pay as much for them. Matching buyers and sellers in call markets is easy because the traders (or their orders) come together at the same time and place. Dealers provide liquidity in quote-driven markets. Public traders as well as dealers provide liquidity in order-driven markets. Order-driven markets arrange trades by ranking orders using precedence rules. The rules generally ensure that traders who provide the best prices, display the most size, and arrive early trade first. Continuous order-driven markets price orders using the discriminatory pricing rule. Under this rule, standing limit orders determine trade prices. Brokers help people trade unique instruments or positions for which finding a buyer or a seller is difficult. Transaction costs are lower in transparent markets than in opaque markets because traders can more easily determine market value and more easily manage their trading in transparent markets. A well-functioning financial system allows people to trade instruments that best solve their wealth and risk management problems with low transaction costs. Complete and liquid markets characterize a well-functioning financial system. Complete markets are markets in which the instruments needed to solve investment and risk management problems are available to trade. Liquid markets are markets in which traders can trade when they want to trade at low cost. The financial system is operationally efficient when its markets are liquid. Liquid markets lower the costs of raising capital. A well-functioning financial system promotes wealth by ensuring that capital allocation decisions are well made. A well-functioning financial system also promotes wealth by allowing people to share the risks associated with valuable products that would otherwise not be undertaken. Prices are informationally efficient when they reflect all available information about fundamental values. Information-motivated traders make prices informationally efficient. Prices will be most informative in liquid markets because information-motivated traders will not invest in information and research if establishing positions based on their analyses is too costly. Regulators generally seek to promote fair and orderly markets in which traders can trade at prices that accurately reflect fundamental values without incurring excessive transaction costs. Governmental agencies and self-regulating organizations of practitioners provide regulatory services that attempt to make markets safer and more efficient. Mandated financial disclosure programs for the issuers of publicly traded securities ensure that information necessary to estimate security values is available to financial analysts on a consistent basis.

For those companies reporting under United States generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP), FASB ASC Topic 740 [Income Taxes] is the primary source for information on accounting for income taxes. Although IFRS and US GAAP follow similar conventions on many income tax issues, there are some key differences that will be discussed in the reading. Differences between how and when transactions are recognized for financial reporting purposes relative to tax reporting can give rise to differences in tax expense and related tax assets and liabilities. To reconcile these differences, companies that report under either IFRS or US GAAP create a provision on the balance sheet called deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities, depending on the nature of the situation. Deferred tax assets or liabilities usually arise when accounting standards and tax authorities recognize the timing of revenues and expenses at different times. Because timing differences such as these will eventually reverse over time, they are called “temporary differences.” Deferred tax assets represent taxes that have been recognized for tax reporting purposes (or often the carrying forward of losses from previous periods) but have not yet been recognized on the income statement prepared for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax liabilities represent tax expense that has appeared on the income statement for financial reporting purposes, but has not yet become payable under tax regulations. This reading provides a primer on the basics of income tax accounting and reporting. The reading is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the differences between taxable income and accounting profit. Section 3 explains the determination of tax base, which relates to the valuation of assets and liabilities for tax purposes. Section 4 discusses several types of timing differences between the recognition of taxable and accounting profit. Section 5 examines unused tax losses and tax credits. Section 6 describes the recognition and measurement of current and deferred tax. Section 7 discusses the disclosure and presentation of income tax information on companies' financial statements and illustrates its practical implications for financial analysis. Section 8 provides an overview of the similarities and differences for income-tax reporting between IFRS and US GAAP. A summary of the key points and practice problems in the CFA Institute multiple-choice format conclude the reading.","The member should be able to: describe the differences between accounting profit and taxable income and define key terms, including deferred tax assets, deferred tax liabilities, valuation allowance, taxes payable, and income tax expense; explain how deferred tax liabilities and assets are created and the factors that determine how a company’s deferred tax liabilities and assets should be treated for the purposes of financial analysis; calculate the tax base of a company’s assets and liabilities; calculate income tax expense, income taxes payable, deferred tax assets, and deferred tax liabilities, and calculate and interpret the adjustment to the financial statements related to a change in the income tax rate; evaluate the effect of tax rate changes on a company’s financial statements and ratios; distinguish between temporary and permanent differences in pre-tax accounting income and taxable income; describe the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets—when it is required and what effect it has on financial statements; explain recognition and measurement of current and deferred tax items; analyze disclosures relating to deferred tax items and the effective tax rate reconciliation and explain how information included in these disclosures affects a company’s financial statements and financial ratios; identify the key provisions of and differences between income tax accounting under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).","Income taxes are a significant category of expense for profitable companies. Analyzing income tax expenses is often difficult for the analyst because there are many permanent and temporary timing differences between the accounting that is used for income tax reporting and the accounting that is used for financial reporting on company financial statements. The financial statements and notes to the financial statements of a company provide important information that the analyst needs to assess financial performance and to compare a company’s financial performance with other companies. Key concepts in this reading are as follows: Differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for tax and accounting purposes may result in taxable income differing from accounting profit. The discrepancy is a result of different treatments of certain income and expenditure items. The tax base of an asset is the amount that will be deductible for tax purposes as an expense in the calculation of taxable income as the company expenses the tax basis of the asset. If the economic benefit will not be taxable, the tax base of the asset will be equal to the carrying amount of the asset. The tax base of a liability is the carrying amount of the liability less any amounts that will be deductible for tax purposes in the future. With respect to revenue received in advance, the tax base of such a liability is the carrying amount less any amount of the revenue that will not be taxable in the future. Temporary differences arise from recognition of differences in the tax base and carrying amount of assets and liabilities. The creation of a deferred tax asset or liability as a result of a temporary difference will only be allowed if the difference reverses itself at some future date and to the extent that it is expected that the balance sheet item will create future economic benefits for the company. Permanent differences result in a difference in tax and financial reporting of revenue (expenses) that will not be reversed at some future date. Because it will not be reversed at a future date, these differences do not constitute temporary differences and do not give rise to a deferred tax asset or liability. Current taxes payable or recoverable are based on the applicable tax rates on the balance sheet date of an entity; in contrast, deferred taxes should be measured at the tax rate that is expected to apply when the asset is realized or the liability settled. All unrecognized deferred tax assets and liabilities must be reassessed on the appropriate balance sheet date and measured against their probable future economic benefit. Deferred tax assets must be assessed for their prospective recoverability. If it is probable that they will not be recovered at all or partly, the carrying amount should be reduced. Under US GAAP, this is done through the use of a valuation allowance.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V3R6-long-lived-assets.pdf,Financial Reporting and Analysis,2023,Level I,"Long-lived assets, also referred to as non-current assets or long-term assets, are assets that are expected to provide economic benefits over a future period of time, typically greater than one year. Long-lived assets may be tangible, intangible, or financial assets. Examples of long-lived tangible assets, typically referred to as and sometimes as fixed assets, include land, buildings, furniture and fixtures, machinery and equipment, and vehicles; examples of long-lived (assets lacking physical substance) include patents and trademarks; and examples of long-lived financial assets include investments in equity or debt securities issued by other entities. The scope of this reading is limited to long-lived tangible and intangible assets (hereafter, referred to for simplicity as long-lived assets). The first issue in accounting for a long-lived asset is determining its cost at acquisition. The second issue is how to allocate the cost to expense over time. The costs of most long-lived assets are capitalised and then allocated as expenses in the profit or loss (income) statement over the period of time during which they are expected to provide economic benefits. The two main types of long-lived assets with costs that are typically not allocated over time are land, which is not depreciated, and those intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Additional issues that arise are the treatment of subsequent costs incurred related to the asset, the use of the cost model versus the revaluation model, unexpected declines in the value of the asset, classification of the asset with respect to intent (for example, held for use or held for sale), and the derecognition of the asset. This reading is organised as follows. Section 2 describes and illustrates accounting for the acquisition of long-lived assets, with particular attention to the impact of capitalizing versus expensing expenditures. Section 3 describes the allocation of the costs of long-lived assets over their useful lives. Section 4 discusses the revaluation model that is based on changes in the fair value of an asset. Section 5 covers the concepts of impairment (unexpected decline in the value of an asset). Section 6 describes accounting for the derecognition of long-lived assets. Section 7 describes financial statement presentation, disclosures, and analysis of long-lived assets. Section 8 discusses differences in financial reporting of investment property compared with property, plant, and equipment. A summary is followed by practice problems.","The member should be able to: distinguish between costs that are capitalised and costs that are expensed in the period in which they are incurred; compare the financial reporting of the following types of intangible assets: purchased, internally developed, acquired in a business combination; explain and evaluate how capitalising versus expensing costs in the period in which they are incurred affects financial statements and ratios; describe the different depreciation methods for property, plant, and equipment and calculate depreciation expense; describe how the choice of depreciation method and assumptions concerning useful life and residual value affect depreciation expense, financial statements, and ratios; describe the different amortisation methods for intangible assets with finite lives and calculate amortisation expense; describe how the choice of amortisation method and assumptions concerning useful life and residual value affect amortisation expense, financial statements, and ratios; describe the revaluation model; explain the impairment of property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets; explain the derecognition of property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets; explain and evaluate how impairment, revaluation, and derecognition of property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets affect financial statements and ratios; describe the financial statement presentation of and disclosures relating to property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets; analyze and interpret financial statement disclosures regarding property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets; compare the financial reporting of investment property with that of property, plant, and equipment.","Understanding the reporting of long-lived assets at inception requires distinguishing between expenditures that are capitalised (i.e., reported as long-lived assets) and those that are expensed. Once a long-lived asset is recognised, it is reported under the cost model at its historical cost less accumulated depreciation (amortisation) and less any impairment or under the revaluation model at its fair value. IFRS permit the use of either the cost model or the revaluation model, whereas US GAAP require the use of the cost model. Most companies reporting under IFRS use the cost model. The choice of different methods to depreciate (amortise) long-lived assets can create challenges for analysts comparing companies. Key points include the following: Expenditures related to long-lived assets are capitalised as part of the cost of assets if they are expected to provide future benefits, typically beyond one year. Otherwise, expenditures related to long-lived assets are expensed as incurred. Although capitalising expenditures, rather than expensing them, results in higher reported profitability in the initial year, it results in lower profitability in subsequent years; however, if a company continues to purchase similar or increasing amounts of assets each year, the profitability-enhancing effect of capitalisation continues. Capitalising an expenditure rather than expensing it results in a greater amount reported as cash from operations because capitalised expenditures are classified as an investing cash outflow rather than an operating cash outflow. Companies must capitalise interest costs associated with acquiring or constructing an asset that requires a long period of time to prepare for its intended use. Including capitalised interest in the calculation of interest coverage ratios provides a better assessment of a company’s solvency. IFRS require research costs be expensed but allow all development costs (not only software development costs) to be capitalised under certain conditions. Generally, US accounting standards require that research and development costs be expensed; however, certain costs related to software development are required to be capitalised. When one company acquires another company, the transaction is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in which the company identified as the acquirer allocates the purchase price to each asset acquired (and each liability assumed) on the basis of its fair value. Under acquisition accounting, if the purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the sum of the amounts that can be allocated to individual identifiable assets and liabilities, the excess is recorded as goodwill. The capitalised costs of long-lived tangible assets and of intangible assets with finite useful lives are allocated to expense in subsequent periods over their useful lives. For tangible assets, this process is referred to as depreciation, and for intangible assets, it is referred to as amortisation. Long-lived tangible assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortised but are reviewed for impairment annually. Impairment disclosures can provide useful information about a company’s expected cash flows. Methods of calculating depreciation or amortisation expense include the straight-line method, in which the cost of an asset is allocated to expense in equal amounts each year over its useful life; accelerated methods, in which the allocation of cost is greater in earlier years; and the units-of-production method, in which the allocation of cost corresponds to the actual use of an asset in a particular period. Estimates required for depreciation and amortisation calculations include the useful life of the equipment (or its total lifetime productive capacity) and its expected residual value at the end of that useful life. A longer useful life and higher expected residual value result in a smaller amount of annual depreciation relative to a shorter useful life and lower expected residual value. IFRS permit the use of either the cost model or the revaluation model for the valuation and reporting of long-lived assets, but the revaluation model is not allowed under US GAAP. Under the revaluation model, carrying amounts are the fair values at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation or amortisation. In contrast with depreciation and amortisation charges, which serve to allocate the cost of a long-lived asset over its useful life, impairment charges reflect an unexpected decline in the fair value of an asset to an amount lower than its carrying amount. IFRS permit impairment losses to be reversed, with the reversal reported in profit. US GAAP do not permit the reversal of impairment losses. The gain or loss on the sale of long-lived assets is computed as the sales proceeds minus the carrying amount of the asset at the time of sale. Estimates of average age and remaining useful life of a company’s assets reflect the relationship between assets accounted for on a historical cost basis and depreciation amounts. The average remaining useful life of a company’s assets can be estimated as net PPE divided by depreciation expense, although the accounting useful life may not necessarily correspond to the economic useful life. Long-lived assets reclassified as held for sale cease to be depreciated or amortised. Long-lived assets to be disposed of other than by a sale (e.g., by abandonment, exchange for another asset, or distribution to owners in a spin-off) are classified as held for use until disposal. Thus, they continue to be depreciated and tested for impairment. Investment property is defined as property that is owned (or, in some cases, leased under a finance lease) for the purpose of earning rentals, capital appreciation, or both. Under IFRS, companies are allowed to value investment properties using either a cost model or a fair value model. The cost model is identical to the cost model used for property, plant, and equipment, but the fair value model differs from the revaluation model used for property, plant, and equipment. Unlike the revaluation model, under the fair value model, all changes in the fair value of investment property affect net income. Under US GAAP, investment properties are generally measured using the cost model.

Often, the decisions and recommendations addressed by financial analysts pertain to providing capital to companies—specifically, whether to invest in the company’s debt or equity securities and at what price. An investor in debt securities is concerned about the company’s ability to pay interest and to repay the principal lent. An investor in equity securities is an owner with a residual interest in the company and is concerned about the company’s ability to pay dividends and the likelihood that its share price will increase. Overall, a central focus of financial analysis is evaluating the company’s ability to earn a return on its capital that is at least equal to the cost of that capital, to profitably grow its operations, and to generate enough cash to meet obligations and pursue opportunities. Fundamental financial analysis starts with the information found in a company’s financial reports. These financial reports include audited financial statements, additional disclosures required by regulatory authorities, and any accompanying (unaudited) commentary by management. Basic financial statement analysis—as presented in this reading—provides a foundation that enables the analyst to better understand other information gathered from research beyond the financial reports. This reading is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the scope of financial statement analysis. Section 3 describes the sources of information used in financial statement analysis, including the primary financial statements (statement of financial position or balance sheet, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, and cash flow statement). Section 4 provides a framework for guiding the financial statement analysis process. A summary of the key points conclude the reading.","The member should be able to: describe the roles of financial reporting and financial statement analysis; describe the roles of the statement of financial position, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, and statement of cash flows in evaluating a company’s performance and financial position; describe the importance of financial statement notes and supplementary information—including disclosures of accounting policies, methods, and estimates—and management’s commentary; describe the objective of audits of financial statements, the types of audit reports, and the importance of effective internal controls; identify and describe information sources that analysts use in financial statement analysis besides annual financial statements and supplementary information; describe the steps in the financial statement analysis framework.","The information presented in financial and other reports, including the financial statements, notes, and management’s commentary, help the financial analyst to assess a company’s performance and financial position. An analyst may be called on to perform a financial analysis for a variety of reasons, including the valuation of equity securities, the assessment of credit risk, the performance of due diligence on an acquisition, and the evaluation of a subsidiary’s performance relative to other business units. Major considerations in both equity analysis and credit analysis are evaluating a company’s financial position, its ability to generate profits and cash flow, and its potential to generate future growth in profits and cash flow. This reading has presented an overview of financial statement analysis. Among the major points covered are the following: The primary purpose of financial reports is to provide information and data about a company’s financial position and performance, including profitability and cash flows. The information presented in the reports —including the financial statements and notes and management’s commentary or management’s discussion and analysis—allows the financial analyst to assess a company’s financial position and performance and trends in that performance. The primary financial statements are the statement of financial position (i.e., the balance sheet), the statement of comprehensive income (or two statements consisting of an income statement and a statement of comprehensive income), the statement of changes in equity, and the statement of cash flows. The balance sheet discloses what resources a company controls (assets) and what it owes (liabilities) at a specific point in time. Owners’ equity represents the net assets of the company; it is the owners’ residual interest in, or residual claim on, the company’s assets after deducting its liabilities. The relationship among the three parts of the balance sheet (assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity) may be shown in equation form as follows: Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ equity. The income statement presents information on the financial results of a company’s business activities over a period of time. The income statement communicates how much revenue and other income the company generated during a period and what expenses, including losses, it incurred in connection with generating that revenue and other income. The basic equation underlying the income statement is Revenue + Other income – Expenses = Net income. The statement of comprehensive income includes all items that change owners’ equity except transactions with owners. Some of these items are included as part of net income, and some are reported as other comprehensive income (OCI). The statement of changes in equity provides information about increases or decreases in the various components of owners’ equity. Although the income statement and balance sheet provide measures of a company’s success, cash and cash flow are also vital to a company’s long-term success. Disclosing the sources and uses of cash helps creditors, investors, and other statement users evaluate the company’s liquidity, solvency, and financial flexibility. The notes (also referred to as footnotes) that accompany the financial statements are an integral part of those statements and provide information that is essential to understanding the statements. Analysts should evaluate note disclosures regarding the use of alternative accounting methods, estimates, and assumptions. In addition to the financial statements, a company provides other sources of information that are useful to the financial analyst. As part of his or her analysis, the financial analyst should read and assess this additional information, particularly that presented in the management commentary (also called management report[ing], operating and financial review, and management’s discussion and analysis [MD&A]). A publicly traded company must have an independent audit performed on its annual financial statements. The auditor’s report expresses an opinion on the financial statements and provides some assurance about whether the financial statements fairly present a company’s financial position, performance, and cash flows. In addition, for US publicly traded companies, auditors must also express an opinion on the company’s internal control systems. Information on the economy, industry, and peer companies is useful in putting the company’s financial performance and position in perspective and in assessing the company’s future. In most cases, information from sources apart from the company are crucial to an analyst’s effectiveness. The financial statement analysis framework provides steps that can be followed in any financial statement analysis project. These steps are: articulate the purpose and context of the analysis; collect input data; process data; analyze/interpret the processed data; develop and communicate conclusions and recommendations; and follow up.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V3R3-understanding-cash-flow-statements.pdf,Financial Reporting and Analysis,2023,Level I,"The cash flow statement provides information about a company’s cash receipts and cash payments during an accounting period. The cash-based information provided by the cash flow statement contrasts with the accrual-based information from the income statement. For example, the income statement reflects revenues when earned rather than when cash is collected; in contrast, the cash flow statement reflects cash receipts when collected as opposed to when the revenue was earned. A reconciliation between reported income and cash flows from operating activities provides useful information about when, whether, and how a company is able to generate cash from its operating activities. Although income is an important measure of the results of a company’s activities, cash flow is also essential. As an extreme illustration, a hypothetical company that makes all sales on account, without regard to whether it will ever collect its accounts receivable, would report healthy sales on its income statement and might well report significant income; however, with zero cash inflow, the company would not survive. The cash flow statement also provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending cash on the balance sheet. In addition to information about cash generated (or, alternatively, cash used) in operating activities, the cash flow statement provides information about cash provided (or used) in a company’s investing and financing activities. This information allows the analyst to answer such questions as: Does the company generate enough cash from its operations to pay for its new investments, or is the company relying on new debt issuance to finance them? Does the company pay its dividends to common stockholders using cash generated from operations, from selling assets, or from issuing debt? Answers to these questions are important because, in theory, generating cash from operations can continue indefinitely, but generating cash from selling assets, for example, is possible only as long as there are assets to sell. Similarly, generating cash from debt financing is possible only as long as lenders are willing to lend, and the lending decision depends on expectations that the company will ultimately have adequate cash to repay its obligations. In summary, information about the sources and uses of cash helps creditors, investors, and other statement users evaluate the company’s liquidity, solvency, and financial flexibility. This reading explains how cash flow activities are reflected in a company’s cash flow statement. The reading is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the components and format of the cash flow statement, including the classification of cash flows under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and the direct and indirect formats for presenting the cash flow statement. Section 3 discusses the linkages of the cash flow statement with the income statement and balance sheet and the steps in the preparation of the cash flow statement. Section 4 demonstrates the analysis of cash flow statements, including the conversion of an indirect cash flow statement to the direct method and how to use common-size cash flow analysis, free cash flow measures, and cash flow ratios used in security analysis. A summary of the key points and practice problems in the CFA Institute multiple-choice format conclude the reading.","The member should be able to: compare cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities and classify cash flow items as relating to one of those three categories given a description of the items; describe how non-cash investing and financing activities are reported; contrast cash flow statements prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and US generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP); distinguish between the direct and indirect methods of presenting cash from operating activities and describe arguments in favor of each method; describe how the cash flow statement is linked to the income statement and the balance sheet; describe the steps in the preparation of direct and indirect cash flow statements, including how cash flows can be computed using income statement and balance sheet data; convert cash flows from the indirect to direct method; analyze and interpret both reported and common-size cash flow statements; calculate and interpret free cash flow to the firm, free cash flow to equity, and performance and coverage cash flow ratios.","The cash flow statement provides important information about a company’s cash receipts and cash payments during an accounting period as well as information about a company’s operating, investing, and financing activities. Although the income statement provides a measure of a company’s success, cash and cash flow are also vital to a company’s long-term success. Information on the sources and uses of cash helps creditors, investors, and other statement users evaluate the company’s liquidity, solvency, and financial flexibility. Key concepts are as follows: Cash flow activities are classified into three categories: operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Significant non-cash transaction activities (if present) are reported by using a supplemental disclosure note to the cash flow statement. Cash flow statements under IFRS and US GAAP are similar; however, IFRS provide companies with more choices in classifying some cash flow items as operating, investing, or financing activities. Companies can use either the direct or the indirect method for reporting their operating cash flow: The direct method discloses operating cash inflows by source (e.g., cash received from customers, cash received from investment income) and operating cash outflows by use (e.g., cash paid to suppliers, cash paid for interest) in the operating activities section of the cash flow statement. The indirect method reconciles net income to operating cash flow by adjusting net income for all non-cash items and the net changes in the operating working capital accounts. The cash flow statement is linked to a company’s income statement and comparative balance sheets and to data on those statements. Although the indirect method is most commonly used by companies, an analyst can generally convert it to an approximation of the direct format by following a simple three-step process. An evaluation of a cash flow statement should involve an assessment of the sources and uses of cash and the main drivers of cash flow within each category of activities. The analyst can use common-size statement analysis for the cash flow statement. Two approaches to developing the common-size statements are the total cash inflows/total cash outflows method and the percentage of net revenues method. The cash flow statement can be used to determine free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE). The cash flow statement may also be used in financial ratios that measure a company’s profitability, performance, and financial strength.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V2R8-currency-exchange-rates.pdf,Economics,2023,Level I,"Measured by daily turnover, the foreign exchange (FX) market—the market in which currencies are traded against each other—is by far the world’s largest market. Current estimates put daily turnover at approximately USD5.1 trillion for 2016. This is about 10 to 15 times larger than daily turnover in global fixed-income markets and about 50 times larger than global turnover in equities. The FX market is also a truly global market that operates 24 hours a day, each business day. It involves market participants from every time zone connected through electronic communications networks that link players as large as multibillion-dollar investment funds and as small as individuals trading for their own account—all brought together in real time. International trade would be impossible without the trade in currencies that facilitates it, and so too would cross-border capital flows that connect all financial markets globally through the FX market. These factors make foreign exchange a key market for investors and market participants to understand. The world economy is increasingly transnational in nature, with both production processes and trade flows often determined more by global factors than by domestic considerations. Likewise, investment portfolio performance increasingly reflects global determinants because pricing in financial markets responds to the array of investment opportunities available worldwide, not just locally. All of these factors funnel through, and are reflected in, the foreign exchange market. As investors shed their “home bias” and invest in foreign markets, the exchange rate—the price at which foreign-currency-denominated investments are valued in terms of the domestic currency—becomes an increasingly important determinant of portfolio performance. Even investors adhering to a purely “domestic” portfolio mandate are increasingly affected by what happens in the foreign exchange market. Given the globalization of the world economy, most large companies depend heavily on their foreign operations (for example, by some estimates about 30 percent of S&P 500 Index earnings are from outside the United States). Almost all companies are exposed to some degree of foreign competition, and the pricing for domestic assets—equities, bonds, real estate, and others—will also depend on demand from foreign investors. All of these various influences on investment performance reflect developments in the foreign exchange market. This reading introduces the foreign exchange market, providing the basic concepts and terminology necessary to understand exchange rates as well as some of the basics of exchange rate economics. The reading is divided up as follows. Section 2 describes the organization of the foreign exchange market and discusses the major players—who they are, how they conduct their business, and how they respond to exchange rate changes. Section 3 takes up the mechanics of exchange rates: definitions, quotes, and calculations. This section shows that the reader has to pay close attention to conventions used in various foreign exchange markets around the world because they can vary widely. Sometimes exchange rates are quoted in the number of domestic currency units per unit of foreign currency, and sometimes they are quoted in the opposite way. The exact notation used to represent exchange rates can vary widely as well, and occasionally the same exchange rate notation will be used by different sources to mean completely different things. The notation used here may not be the same as that encountered elsewhere. Therefore, the focus should be on understanding the underlying concepts rather than relying on rote memorization of formulas. We also show how to calculate cross-exchange rates and how to compute the forward exchange rate given either the forward points or the percentage forward premium or discount. In Section 4, we discuss alternative exchange rate regimes operating throughout the world. Finally, in Section 5, we discuss how exchange rates affect a country’s international trade (exports and imports) and capital flows. A summary and practice problems conclude the reading.","The member should be able to: define an exchange rate and distinguish between nominal and real exchange rates and spot and forward exchange rates; describe functions of and participants in the foreign exchange market; calculate and interpret the percentage change in a currency relative to another currency; calculate and interpret currency cross-rates; convert forward quotations expressed on a points basis or in percentage terms into an outright forward quotation; explain the arbitrage relationship between spot rates, forward rates, and interest rates; calculate and interpret a forward discount or premium; calculate and interpret the forward rate consistent with the spot rate and the interest rate in each currency; describe exchange rate regimes; explain the effects of exchange rates on countries’ international trade and capital flows.","Foreign exchange markets are crucial for understanding both the functioning of the global economy as well as the performance of investment portfolios. In this reading, we have described the diverse array of FX market participants and have introduced some of the basic concepts necessary to understand the structure and functions of these markets. The reader should be able to understand how exchange rates—both spot and forward—are quoted and be able to calculate cross exchange rates and forward rates. We also have described the array of exchange rate regimes that characterize foreign exchange markets globally and how these regimes determine the flexibility of exchange rates, and hence, the degree of foreign exchange rate risk that international investments are exposed to. Finally, we have discussed how movements in exchange rates affect international trade flows (imports and exports) and capital flows. The following points, among others, are made in this reading: Measured by average daily turnover, the foreign exchange market is by far the largest financial market in the world. It has important effects, either directly or indirectly, on the pricing and flows in all other financial markets. There is a wide diversity of global FX market participants that have a wide variety of motives for entering into foreign exchange transactions. Individual currencies are usually referred to by standardized three-character codes. These currency codes can also be used to define exchange rates (the price of one currency in terms of another). There are a variety of exchange rate quoting conventions commonly used. A direct currency quote takes the domestic currency as the price currency and the foreign currency as the base currency (i.e., S d/f ). An indirect quote uses the domestic currency as the base currency (i.e., S f/d ). To convert between direct and indirect quotes, the inverse (reciprocal) is used. Professional FX markets use standardized conventions for how the exchange rate for specific currency pairs will be quoted. Currencies trade in foreign exchange markets based on nominal exchange rates. An increase (decrease) in the exchange rate, quoted in indirect terms, means that the domestic currency is appreciating (depreciating) versus the foreign currency. The real exchange rate, defined as the nominal exchange rate multiplied by the ratio of price levels, measures the relative purchasing power of the currencies. An increase in the real exchange rate ( R d/f ) implies a reduction in the relative purchasing power of the domestic currency. Given exchange rates for two currency pairs—A/B and A/C—we can compute the cross-rate (B/C) between currencies B and C. Depending on how the rates are quoted, this may require inversion of one of the quoted rates. Spot exchange rates are for immediate settlement (typically, T + 2), while forward exchange rates are for settlement at agreed-upon future dates. Forward rates can be used to manage foreign exchange risk exposures or can be combined with spot transactions to create FX swaps. The spot exchange rate, the forward exchange rate, and the domestic and foreign interest rates must jointly satisfy an arbitrage relationship that equates the investment return on two alternative but equivalent investments. Given the spot exchange rate and the foreign and domestic interest rates, the forward exchange rate must take the value that prevents riskless arbitrage. Forward rates are typically quoted in terms of forward (or swap) points. The swap points are added to the spot exchange rate in order to calculate the forward rate. Occasionally, forward rates are presented in terms of percentages relative to the spot rate. The base currency is said to be trading at a forward premium if the forward rate is above the spot rate (forward points are positive). Conversely, the base currency is said to be trading at a forward discount if the forward rate is below the spot rate (forward points are negative). The currency with the higher (lower) interest rate will trade at a forward discount (premium). Swap points are proportional to the spot exchange rate and to the interest rate differential and approximately proportional to the term of the forward contract. Empirical studies suggest that forward exchange rates may be unbiased predictors of future spot rates, but the margin of error on such forecasts is too large for them to be used in practice as a guide to managing exchange rate exposures. FX markets are too complex and too intertwined with other global financial markets to be adequately characterized by a single variable, such as the interest rate differential. Virtually every exchange rate is managed to some degree by central banks. The policy framework that each central bank adopts is called an exchange rate regime. These regimes range from using another country’s currency (dollarization), to letting the market determine the exchange rate (independent float). In practice, most regimes fall in between these extremes. The type of exchange rate regime used varies widely among countries and over time. An ideal currency regime would have three properties: (1) the exchange rate between any two currencies would be credibly fixed; (2) all currencies would be fully convertible; and (3) each country would be able to undertake fully independent monetary policy in pursuit of domestic objectives, such as growth and inflation targets. However, these conditions are inconsistent. In particular, a fixed exchange rate and unfettered capital flows severely limit a country’s ability to undertake independent monetary policy. Hence, there cannot be an ideal currency regime. The IMF identifies the following types of regimes: arrangements with no separate legal tender (dollarization, monetary union), currency board, fixed parity, target zone, crawling peg, crawling band, managed float, and independent float. Most major currencies traded in FX markets are freely floating, albeit subject to occasional central bank intervention. A trade surplus (deficit) must be matched by a corresponding deficit (surplus) in the capital account. Any factor that affects the trade balance must have an equal and opposite impact on the capital account, and vice versa. A trade surplus reflects an excess of domestic saving (including the government fiscal balance) over investment spending. A trade deficit indicates that the country invests more than it saves and must finance the excess by borrowing from foreigners or selling assets to foreigners. The impact of the exchange rate on trade and capital flows can be analyzed from two perspectives. The elasticities approach focuses on the effect of changing the relative price of domestic and foreign goods. This approach highlights changes in the composition of spending. The absorption approach focuses on the impact of exchange rates on aggregate expenditure/saving decisions. The elasticities approach leads to the Marshall–Lerner condition, which describes combinations of export and import demand elasticities such that depreciation (appreciation) of the domestic currency will move the trade balance toward surplus (deficit). The idea underlying the Marshall–Lerner condition is that demand for imports and exports must be sufficiently price-sensitive so that an increase in the relative price of imports increases the difference between export receipts and import expenditures. In order to move the trade balance toward surplus (deficit), a change in the exchange rate must decrease (increase) domestic expenditure (also called absorption) relative to income. Equivalently, it must increase (decrease) domestic saving relative to domestic investment. If there is excess capacity in the economy, then currency depreciation can increase output/income by switching demand toward domestically produced goods and services. Because some of the additional income will be saved, income rises relative to expenditure and the trade balance improves. If the economy is at full employment, then currency depreciation must reduce domestic expenditure in order to improve the trade balance. The main mechanism is a wealth effect: A weaker currency reduces the purchasing power of domestic-currency-denominated assets (including the present value of current and future earned income), and households respond by reducing expenditure and increasing saving.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V4R3-measures-leverage.pdf,Corporate Finance,2023,Level I,"This reading presents elementary topics in leverage. Leverage is the use of fixed costs in a company’s cost structure. Fixed costs that are operating costs (such as depreciation or rent) create operating leverage. Fixed costs that are financial costs (such as interest expense) create financial leverage. Analysts refer to the use of fixed costs as leverage because fixed costs act as a fulcrum for the company’s earnings. Leverage can magnify earnings both up and down. The profits of highly leveraged companies might soar with small upturns in revenue. But the reverse is also true: Small downturns in revenue may lead to losses. Analysts need to understand a company’s use of leverage for three main reasons. First, the degree of leverage is an important component in assessing a company’s risk and return characteristics. Second, analysts may be able to discern information about a company’s business and future prospects from management’s decisions about the use of operating and financial leverage. Knowing how to interpret these signals also helps the analyst evaluate the quality of management’s decisions. Third, the valuation of a company requires forecasting future cash flows and assessing the risk associated with those cash flows. Understanding a company’s use of leverage should help in forecasting cash flows and in selecting an appropriate discount rate for finding their present value. The reading is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces leverage and defines important terms. Section 3 illustrates and discusses measures of operating leverage and financial leverage, which combine to define a measure of total leverage that gauges the sensitivity of net income to a given percent change in units sold. This section also covers breakeven points in using leverage and corporate reorganization (a possible consequence of using leverage inappropriately). A summary and practice problems conclude this reading.","The member should be able to: define and explain leverage, business risk, sales risk, operating risk, and financial risk and classify a risk; calculate and interpret the degree of operating leverage, the degree of financial leverage, and the degree of total leverage; analyze the effect of financial leverage on a company’s net income and return on equity; calculate the breakeven quantity of sales and determine the company's net income at various sales levels; calculate and interpret the operating breakeven quantity of sales.","In this reading, we have reviewed the fundamentals of business risk, financial risk, and measures of leverage. Leverage is the use of fixed costs in a company’s cost structure. Business risk is the risk associated with operating earnings and reflects both sales risk (uncertainty with respect to the price and quantity of sales) and operating risk (the risk related to the use of fixed costs in operations). Financial risk is the risk associated with how a company finances its operations (i.e., the split between equity and debt financing of the business). The degree of operating leverage (DOL) is the ratio of the percentage change in operating income to the percentage change in units sold. We can use the following formula to measure the degree of operating leverage: DOL = Q ( P − V ) Q ( P − V ) − F The degree of financial leverage (DFL) is the percentage change in net income for a one percent change in operating income. We can use the following formula to measure the degree of financial leverage: DFL = [ Q ( P − V ) − F ] ( 1 − t ) [ Q ( P − V ) − F − C ] ( 1 − t ) = [ Q ( P − V ) − F ] [ Q ( P − V ) − F − C ] The degree of total leverage (DTL) is a measure of the sensitivity of net income to changes in unit sales, which is equivalent to DTL = DOL × DFL. The breakeven point, Q BE , is the number of units produced and sold at which the company’s net income is zero, which we calculate as Q BE = F + C P − V The operating breakeven point, Q OBE , is the number of units produced and sold at which the company’s operating income is zero, which we calculate as

Further, inventory may represent a significant asset on these companies’ balance sheets. Merchandisers (wholesalers and retailers) purchase inventory, ready for sale, from manufacturers and thus account for only one type of inventory—finished goods inventory. Manufacturers, however, purchase raw materials from suppliers and then add value by transforming the raw materials into finished goods. They typically classify inventory into three different categories: raw materials, work in progress, and finished goods. Work-in-progress inventories have started the conversion process from raw materials but are not yet finished goods ready for sale. Manufacturers may report either the separate carrying amounts of their raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods inventories on the balance sheet or simply the total inventory amount. If the latter approach is used, the company must then disclose the carrying amounts of its raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods inventories in a footnote to the financial statements. Inventories and cost of sales (cost of goods sold) are significant items in the financial statements of many companies. Comparing the performance of these companies is challenging because of the allowable choices for valuing inventories: Differences in the choice of inventory valuation method can result in significantly different amounts being assigned to inventory and cost of sales. Financial statement analysis would be much easier if all companies used the same inventory valuation method or if inventory price levels remained constant over time. If there was no inflation or deflation with respect to inventory costs and thus unit costs were unchanged, the choice of inventory valuation method would be irrelevant. However, inventory price levels typically do change over time. International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) permit the assignment of inventory costs (costs of goods available for sale) to inventories and cost of sales by three cost formulas: specific identification, first-in, first-out (FIFO), and weighted average cost. US generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP) allow the same three inventory valuation methods, referred to as cost flow assumptions in US GAAP, but also include a fourth method called last-in, first-out (LIFO). The choice of inventory valuation method affects the allocation of the cost of goods available for sale to ending inventory and cost of sales. Analysts must understand the various inventory valuation methods and the related impact on financial statements and financial ratios in order to evaluate a company’s performance over time and relative to industry peers. The company’s financial statements and related notes provide important information that the analyst can use in assessing the impact of the choice of inventory valuation method on financial statements and financial ratios. This reading is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the costs that are included in inventory and the costs that are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. Section 3 describes inventory valuation methods and compares the measurement of ending inventory, cost of sales and gross profit under each method, and when using periodic versus perpetual inventory systems. Section 4 describes the LIFO method, LIFO reserve, and effects of LIFO liquidations, and demonstrates the adjustments required to compare a company that uses LIFO with one that uses FIFO. Section 5 describes the financial statement effects of a change in inventory valuation method. Section 6 discusses the measurement and reporting of inventory when its value changes. Section 7 describes the presentation of inventories on the financial statements and related disclosures, discusses inventory ratios and their interpretation, and shows examples of financial analysis with respect to inventories. A summary and practice problems conclude the reading.","The member should be able to: distinguish between costs included in inventories and costs recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred; describe different inventory valuation methods (cost formulas); calculate and compare cost of sales, gross profit, and ending inventory using different inventory valuation methods and using perpetual and periodic inventory systems; calculate and explain how inflation and deflation of inventory costs affect the financial statements and ratios of companies that use different inventory valuation methods; explain LIFO reserve and LIFO liquidation and their effects on financial statements and ratios; convert a company’s reported financial statements from LIFO to FIFO for purposes of comparison; describe the measurement of inventory at the lower of cost and net realisable value; describe implications of valuing inventory at net realisable value for financial statements and ratios; describe the financial statement presentation of and disclosures relating to inventories; explain issues that analysts should consider when examining a company’s inventory disclosures and other sources of information; calculate and compare ratios of companies, including companies that use different inventory methods; analyze and compare the financial statements of companies, including companies that use different inventory methods.","The choice of inventory valuation method (cost formula or cost flow assumption) can have a potentially significant impact on inventory carrying amounts and cost of sales. These in turn impact other financial statement items, such as current assets, total assets, gross profit, and net income. The financial statements and accompanying notes provide important information about a company’s inventory accounting policies that the analyst needs to correctly assess financial performance and compare it with that of other companies. Key concepts in this reading are as follows: Inventories are a major factor in the analysis of merchandising and manufacturing companies. Such companies generate their sales and profits through inventory transactions on a regular basis. An important consideration in determining profits for these companies is measuring the cost of sales when inventories are sold. The total cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion, and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Storage costs of finished inventory and abnormal costs due to waste are typically treated as expenses in the period in which they occurred. The allowable inventory valuation methods implicitly involve different assumptions about cost flows. The choice of inventory valuation method determines how the cost of goods available for sale during the period is allocated between inventory and cost of sales. IFRS allow three inventory valuation methods (cost formulas): first-in, first-out (FIFO); weighted average cost; and specific identification. The specific identification method is used for inventories of items that are not ordinarily interchangeable and for goods or services produced and segregated for specific projects. US GAAP allow the three methods above plus the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The LIFO method is widely used in the United States for both tax and financial reporting purposes because of potential income tax savings. The choice of inventory method affects the financial statements and any financial ratios that are based on them. As a consequence, the analyst must carefully consider inventory valuation method differences when evaluating a company’s performance over time or in comparison to industry data or industry competitors. A company must use the same cost formula for all inventories having a similar nature and use to the entity. The inventory accounting system (perpetual or periodic) may result in different values for cost of sales and ending inventory when the weighted average cost or LIFO inventory valuation method is used. Under US GAAP, companies that use the LIFO method must disclose in their financial notes the amount of the LIFO reserve or the amount that would have been reported in inventory if the FIFO method had been used. This information can be used to adjust reported LIFO inventory and cost of goods sold balances to the FIFO method for comparison purposes. LIFO liquidation occurs when the number of units in ending inventory declines from the number of units that were present at the beginning of the year. If inventory unit costs have generally risen from year to year, this will produce an inventory-related increase in gross profits. Consistency of inventory costing is required under both IFRS and US GAAP. If a company changes an accounting policy, the change must be justifiable and applied retrospectively to the financial statements. An exception to the retrospective restatement is when a company reporting under US GAAP changes to the LIFO method. Under IFRS, inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Under US GAAP, inventories are measured at the lower of cost, market value, or net realisable value depending upon the inventory method used. Market value is defined as current replacement cost subject to an upper limit of net realizable value and a lower limit of net realizable value less a normal profit margin. Reversals of previous write-downs are permissible under IFRS but not under US GAAP. Reversals of inventory write-downs may occur under IFRS but are not allowed under US GAAP. Changes in the carrying amounts within inventory classifications (such as raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods) may provide signals about a company’s future sales and profits. Relevant information with respect to inventory management and future sales may be found in the Management Discussion and Analysis or similar items within the annual or quarterly reports, industry news and publications, and industry economic data. The inventory turnover ratio, number of days of inventory ratio, and gross profit margin ratio are useful in evaluating the management of a company’s inventory. Inventory management may have a substantial impact on a company’s activity, profitability, liquidity, and solvency ratios. It is critical for the analyst to be aware of industry trends and management’s intentions. Financial statement disclosures provide information regarding the accounting policies adopted in measuring inventories, the principal uncertainties regarding the use of estimates related to inventories, and details of the inventory carrying amounts and costs. This information can greatly assist analysts in their evaluation of a company’s inventory management.

What information is gathered and how it is processed depend on the analyst and the purpose of the analysis. Technical analysis uses such information as stock price and trading volume as the basis for investment decisions. Fundamental analysis uses information about the economy, industry, and company as the basis for investment decisions. Examples of fundamentals are unemployment rates, gross domestic product (GDP) growth, industry growth, and quality of and growth in company earnings. Whereas technical analysts use information to predict price movements and base investment decisions on the direction of predicted change in prices, fundamental analysts use information to estimate the value of a security and to compare the estimated value to the market price and then base investment decisions on that comparison. This reading introduces equity valuation models used to estimate the intrinsic value (synonym: fundamental value ) of a security; intrinsic value is based on an analysis of investment fundamentals and characteristics. The fundamentals to be considered depend on the analyst’s approach to valuation. In a top-down approach, an analyst examines the economic environment, identifies sectors that are expected to prosper in that environment, and analyzes securities of companies from previously identified attractive sectors. In a bottom-up approach, an analyst typically follows an industry or industries and forecasts fundamentals for the companies in those industries in order to determine valuation. Whatever the approach, an analyst who estimates the intrinsic value of an equity security is implicitly questioning the accuracy of the market price as an estimate of value. Valuation is particularly important in active equity portfolio management, which aims to improve on the return–risk trade-off of a portfolio’s benchmark by identifying mispriced securities. This reading is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the implications of differences between estimated value and market price. Section 3 introduces three major categories of valuation model. Section 4 presents an overview of present value models with a focus on the dividend discount model. Section 5 describes and examines the use of multiples in valuation. Section 6 explains asset-based valuation and demonstrates how these models can be used to estimate value. Section 7 states conclusions and summarizes the reading.","The member should be able to: evaluate whether a security, given its current market price and a value estimate, is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued by the market; describe major categories of equity valuation models; describe regular cash dividends, extra dividends, stock dividends, stock splits, reverse stock splits, and share repurchases; describe dividend payment chronology; explain the rationale for using present value models to value equity and describe the dividend discount and free-cash-flow-to-equity models; calculate the intrinsic value of a non-callable, non-convertible preferred stock; calculate and interpret the intrinsic value of an equity security based on the Gordon (constant) growth dividend discount model or a two-stage dividend discount model, as appropriate; identify characteristics of companies for which the constant growth or a multistage dividend discount model is appropriate; explain the rationale for using price multiples to value equity, how the price to earnings multiple relates to fundamentals, and the use of multiples based on comparables; calculate and interpret the following multiples: price to earnings, price to an estimate of operating cash flow, price to sales, and price to book value; describe enterprise value multiples and their use in estimating equity value; describe asset-based valuation models and their use in estimating equity value; explain advantages and disadvantages of each category of valuation model.","The equity valuation models used to estimate intrinsic value—present value models, multiplier models, and asset-based valuation—are widely used and serve an important purpose. The valuation models presented here are a foundation on which to base analysis and research but must be applied wisely. Valuation is not simply a numerical analysis. The choice of model and the derivation of inputs require skill and judgment. When valuing a company or group of companies, the analyst wants to choose a valuation model that is appropriate for the information available to be used as inputs. The available data will, in most instances, restrict the choice of model and influence the way it is used. Complex models exist that may improve on the simple valuation models described in this reading; but before using those models and assuming that complexity increases accuracy, the analyst would do well to consider the “law of parsimony:” A model should be kept as simple as possible in light of the available inputs. Valuation is a fallible discipline, and any method will result in an inaccurate forecast at some time. The goal is to minimize the inaccuracy of the forecast. Among the points made in this reading are the following: An analyst estimating intrinsic value is implicitly questioning the market’s estimate of value. If the estimated value exceeds the market price, the analyst infers the security is undervalued . If the estimated value equals the market price, the analyst infers the security is fairly valued . If the estimated value is less than the market price, the analyst infers the security is overvalued . Because of the uncertainties involved in valuation, an analyst may require that value estimates differ markedly from market price before concluding that a misvaluation exists. Analysts often use more than one valuation model because of concerns about the applicability of any particular model and the variability in estimates that result from changes in inputs. Three major categories of equity valuation models are present value, multiplier, and asset-based valuation models. Present value models estimate value as the present value of expected future benefits. Multiplier models estimate intrinsic value based on a multiple of some fundamental variable. Asset-based valuation models estimate value based on the estimated value of assets and liabilities. The choice of model will depend upon the availability of information to input into the model and the analyst’s confidence in both the information and the appropriateness of the model. Companies distribute cash to shareholders using dividend payments and share repurchases. Regular cash dividends are a key input to dividend valuation models. Key dates in dividend chronology are the declaration date, ex-dividend date, holder-of-record date, and payment date. In the dividend discount model, value is estimated as the present value of expected future dividends. In the free cash flow to equity model, value is estimated as the present value of expected future free cash flow to equity. The Gordon growth model, a simple DDM, estimates value as D 1 /( r – g ). The two stage dividend discount model estimates value as the sum of the present values of dividends over a short-term period of high growth and the present value of the terminal value at the end of the period of high growth. The terminal value is estimated using the Gordon growth model. The choice of dividend model is based upon the patterns assumed with respect to future dividends. Multiplier models typically use multiples of the form: P/ measure of fundamental variable or EV/ measure of fundamental variable. Multiples can be based upon fundamentals or comparables. Asset-based valuations models estimate value of equity as the value of the assets less the value of liabilities.

It acquires the capital or funds necessary to make such investments by borrowing (i.e., using debt financing) or by using funds from the owners (i.e., equity financing). By applying this capital to investments with long-term benefits, the company is producing value today. How much value? The answer depends not only on the investments’ expected future cash flows but also on the cost of the funds. Borrowing is not costless, nor is using owners’ funds. The cost of this capital is an important ingredient in both investment decision making by the company’s management and the valuation of the company by investors. If a company invests in projects that produce a return in excess of the cost of capital, the company has created value; in contrast, if the company invests in projects whose returns are less than the cost of capital, the company has destroyed value. Therefore, the estimation of the cost of capital is a central issue in corporate financial management and for an analyst seeking to evaluate a company’s investment program and its competitive position. Cost of capital estimation is a challenging task. As we have already implied, the cost of capital is not observable but, rather, must be estimated. Arriving at a cost of capital estimate requires a multitude of assumptions and estimates. Another challenge is that the cost of capital that is appropriately applied to a specific investment depends on the characteristics of that investment: The riskier the investment’s cash flows, the greater its cost of capital. In reality, a company must estimate project-specific costs of capital. What is often done, however, is to estimate the cost of capital for the company as a whole and then adjust this overall corporate cost of capital upward or downward to reflect the risk of the contemplated project relative to the company’s average project. This reading is organized as follows: In Section 2, we introduce the cost of capital and its basic computation. Section 3 presents a selection of methods for estimating the costs of the various sources of capital: debt, preferred stock, and common equity. For the latter, two approaches for estimating the equity risk premium are mentioned. Section 4 discusses beta estimation, a key input in using the CAPM to calculate the cost of equity, and Section 5 examines the correct treatment of flotation, or capital issuance, costs. Section 6 highlights methods used by corporations, and a summary concludes the reading.","The member should be able to: calculate and interpret the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of a company; describe how taxes affect the cost of capital from different capital sources; calculate and interpret the cost of debt capital using the yield-to-maturity approach and the debt-rating approach; calculate and interpret the cost of noncallable, nonconvertible preferred stock; calculate and interpret the cost of equity capital using the capital asset pricing model approach and the bond yield plus risk premium approach; explain and demonstrate beta estimation for public companies, thinly traded public companies, and nonpublic companies; explain and demonstrate the correct treatment of flotation costs.","In this reading, we provided an overview of the techniques used to calculate the cost of capital for companies and projects. We examined the weighted average cost of capital, discussing the methods commonly used to estimate the component costs of capital and the weights applied to these components. The weighted average cost of capital is a weighted average of the after-tax marginal costs of each source of capital: WACC = w d r d (1 – t ) + w p r p + w e r e The before-tax cost of debt is generally estimated by either the yield-to-maturity method or the bond rating method. The yield-to-maturity method of estimating the before-tax cost of debt uses the familiar bond valuation equation. Assuming semi-annual coupon payments, the equation is P 0 = P M T 1 ( 1 + r d 2 ) + … + P M T n ( 1 + r d 2 ) n + F V ( 1 + r d 2 ) n = ( ∑ t = 1 n P M T t ( 1 + r d 2 ) t ) + F V ( 1 + r d 2 ) n We solve for the six-month yield ( r d /2) and then annualize it to arrive at the before-tax cost of debt, r d . Because interest payments are generally tax deductible, the after-tax cost is the true, effective cost of debt to the company. If a yield to maturity or bond rating is not available, such as in the case of a private company without rated debt or a project, the estimate of the cost of debt becomes more challenging. The cost of preferred stock is the preferred stock dividend divided by the current preferred stock price: r p = D p P p The cost of equity is the rate of return required by a company’s common stockholders. We estimate this cost using the CAPM (or its variants). The CAPM is the approach most commonly used to calculate the cost of equity. The three components needed to calculate the cost of equity are the risk-free rate, the equity risk premium, and beta: E ( R i ) = R F + β i [ E ( R M ) − R F ] In estimating the cost of equity, an alternative to the CAPM is the bond yield plus risk premium approach. In this approach, we estimate the before-tax cost of debt and add a risk premium that reflects the additional risk associated with the company’s equity. When estimating the cost of equity capital using the CAPM when we do not have publicly traded equity, we may be able to use the pure-play method in which we estimate the unlevered beta for a company with similar business risk, β U , β U,comparable = β L,comparable [ 1 + ( ( 1 − t comparable ) D comparable E comparable ) ] and then lever this beta to reflect the financial risk of the project or company: β L,project = β U,comparable [ 1 + ( ( 1 − t project ) D project E project ) ] Then, we lever this beta to reflect the financial risk of the project or company: Flotation costs are costs incurred in the process of raising additional capital. The preferred method of including these costs in the analysis is as an initial cash flow in the valuation analysis. Survey evidence tells us that the CAPM method is the most popular method used by companies in estimating the cost of equity. The CAPM method is more popular with larger, publicly traded companies, which is understandable considering the additional analyses and assumptions required in estimating systematic risk for a private company or project.

As an asset class, equity plays a fundamental role in investment analysis and portfolio management because it represents a significant portion of many individual and institutional investment portfolios. The study of equity securities is important for many reasons. First, the decision on how much of a client’s portfolio to allocate to equities affects the risk and return characteristics of the entire portfolio. Second, different types of equity securities have different ownership claims on a company’s net assets, which affect their risk and return characteristics in different ways. Finally, variations in the features of equity securities are reflected in their market prices, so it is important to understand the valuation implications of these features. This reading provides an overview of equity securities and their different features and establishes the background required to analyze and value equity securities in a global context. It addresses the following questions: What distinguishes common shares from preference shares, and what purposes do these securities serve in financing a company’s operations? What are convertible preference shares, and why are they often used to raise equity for unseasoned or highly risky companies? What are private equity securities, and how do they differ from public equity securities? What are depository receipts and their various types, and what is the rationale for investing in them? What are the risk factors involved in investing in equity securities? How do equity securities create company value? What is the relationship between a company’s cost of equity, its return on equity, and investors’ required rate of return? The remainder of this reading is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of global equity markets and their historical performance. Section 3 examines the different types and characteristics of equity securities, and Section 4 outlines the differences between public and private equity securities. Section 5 provides an overview of the various types of equity securities listed and traded in global markets. Section 6 discusses the risk and return characteristics of equity securities. Section 7 examines the role of equity securities in creating company value and the relationship between a company’s cost of equity, its return on equity, and investors’ required rate of return. The final section summarizes the reading.","The member should be able to: describe characteristics of types of equity securities; describe differences in voting rights and other ownership characteristics among different equity classes; distinguish between public and private equity securities; describe methods for investing in non-domestic equity securities; compare the risk and return characteristics of different types of equity securities; explain the role of equity securities in the financing of a company’s assets; distinguish between the market value and book value of equity securities; compare a company’s cost of equity, its (accounting) return on equity, and investors’ required rates of return.","Equity securities play a fundamental role in investment analysis and portfolio management. The importance of this asset class continues to grow on a global scale because of the need for equity capital in developed and emerging markets, technological innovation, and the growing sophistication of electronic information exchange. Given their absolute return potential and ability to impact the risk and return characteristics of portfolios, equity securities are of importance to both individual and institutional investors. This reading introduces equity securities and provides an overview of global equity markets. A detailed analysis of their historical performance shows that equity securities have offered average real annual returns superior to government bills and bonds, which have provided average real annual returns that have only kept pace with inflation. The different types and characteristics of common and preference equity securities are examined, and the primary differences between public and private equity securities are outlined. An overview of the various types of equity securities listed and traded in global markets is provided, including a discussion of their risk and return characteristics. Finally, the role of equity securities in creating company value is examined as well as the relationship between a company’s cost of equity, its accounting return on equity, investors’ required rate of return, and the company’s intrinsic value. We conclude with a summary of the key components of this reading: Common shares represent an ownership interest in a company and give investors a claim on its operating performance, the opportunity to participate in the corporate decision-making process, and a claim on the company’s net assets in the case of liquidation. Callable common shares give the issuer the right to buy back the shares from shareholders at a price determined when the shares are originally issued. Putable common shares give shareholders the right to sell the shares back to the issuer at a price specified when the shares are originally issued. Preference shares are a form of equity in which payments made to preference shareholders take precedence over any payments made to common stockholders. Cumulative preference shares are preference shares on which dividend payments are accrued so that any payments omitted by the company must be paid before another dividend can be paid to common shareholders. Non-cumulative preference shares have no such provisions, implying that the dividend payments are at the company’s discretion and are thus similar to payments made to common shareholders. Participating preference shares allow investors to receive the standard preferred dividend plus the opportunity to receive a share of corporate profits above a pre-specified amount. Non-participating preference shares allow investors to simply receive the initial investment plus any accrued dividends in the event of liquidation. Callable and putable preference shares provide issuers and investors with the same rights and obligations as their common share counterparts. Private equity securities are issued primarily to institutional investors in private placements and do not trade in secondary equity markets. There are three types of private equity investments: venture capital, leveraged buyouts, and private investments in public equity (PIPE). The objective of private equity investing is to increase the ability of the company’s management to focus on its operating activities for long-term value creation. The strategy is to take the “private” company “public” after certain profit and other benchmarks have been met. Depository receipts are securities that trade like ordinary shares on a local exchange but which represent an economic interest in a foreign company. They allow the publicly listed shares of foreign companies to be traded on an exchange outside their domestic market. American depository receipts are US dollar-denominated securities trading much like standard US securities on US markets. Global depository receipts are similar to ADRs but contain certain restrictions in terms of their ability to be resold among investors. Underlying characteristics of equity securities can greatly affect their risk and return. A company’s accounting return on equity is the total return that it earns on shareholders’ book equity. A company’s cost of equity is the minimum rate of return that stockholders require the company to pay them for investing in its equity.

Industry analysis is useful for: understanding a company’s business and business environment; identifying active equity investment opportunities; formulating an industry or sector rotation strategy; and portfolio performance attribution. The three main approaches to classifying companies are: products and/or services supplied; business-cycle sensitivities; and statistical similarities. Commercial industry classification systems include: Global Industry Classification Standard; Russell Global Sectors; and Industry Classification Benchmark. Governmental industry classification systems include: International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities; Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community; Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification; and North American Industry Classification System. A limitation of current classification systems is that the narrowest classification unit assigned to a company generally cannot be assumed to constitute its peer group for the purposes of detailed fundamental comparisons or valuation. A peer group is a group of companies engaged in similar business activities whose economics and valuation are influenced by closely related factors. Steps in constructing a preliminary list of peer companies: Examine commercial classification systems if available. These systems often provide a useful starting point for identifying companies operating in the same industry. Review the subject company’s annual report for a discussion of the competitive environment. Companies frequently cite specific competitors. Review competitors’ annual reports to identify other potential comparables. Review industry trade publications to identify additional peer companies. Confirm that each comparable or peer company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from a similar business activity as the subject company. Not all industries are created equal. Some are highly competitive, with many companies struggling to earn returns in excess of their cost of capital, and other industries have attractive characteristics that enable a majority of industry participants to generate healthy profits. Differing competitive environments are determined by the structural attributes of the industry. For this important reason, industry analysis is a vital complement to company analysis. The analyst needs to understand the context in which a company operates to fully understand the opportunities and threats that a company faces. The framework for strategic analysis known as “Porter’s five forces” can provide a useful starting point. Porter maintains that the profitability of companies in an industry is determined by five forces: 1) The threat of new entrants, which in turn is determined by economies of scale, brand loyalty, absolute cost advantages, customer switching costs, and government regulation; 2) the bargaining power of suppliers, which is a function of the feasibility of product substitution, the concentration of the buyer and supplier groups, and switching costs and entry costs in each case; 3) the bargaining power of buyers, which is a function of switching costs among customers and the ability of customers to produce their own product; 4) the threat of substitutes; and 5) the intensity of rivalry among existing competitors, which in turn is a function of industry competitive structure, demand conditions, cost conditions, and the height of exit barriers. The concept of barriers to entry refers to the ease with which new competitors can challenge incumbents and can be an important factor in determining the competitive environment of an industry. If new competitors can easily enter the industry, the industry is likely to be highly competitive because incumbents that attempt to raise prices will be undercut by newcomers. As a result, industries with low barriers to entry tend to have low pricing power. Conversely, if incumbents are protected by barriers to entry, they may enjoy a more benign competitive environment that gives them greater pricing power over their customers because they do not have to worry about being undercut by upstarts. Industry concentration is often, although not always, a sign that an industry may have pricing power and rational competition. Industry fragmentation is a much stronger signal, however, that the industry is competitive and pricing power is limited. The effect of industry capacity on pricing is clear: Tight capacity gives participants more pricing power because demand for products or services exceeds supply; overcapacity leads to price cutting and a highly competitive environment as excess supply chases demand. The analyst should think about not only current capacity conditions but also future changes in capacity levels—how long it takes for supply and demand to come into balance and what effect that process has on industry pricing power and returns. Examining the market share stability of an industry over time is similar to thinking about barriers to entry and the frequency with which new players enter an industry. Stable market shares typically indicate less competitive industries, whereas unstable market shares often indicate highly competitive industries with limited pricing power. An industry’s position in its life cycle often has a large impact on its competitive dynamics, so it is important to keep this positioning in mind when performing strategic analysis of an industry. Industries, like individual companies, tend to evolve over time and usually experience significant changes in the rate of growth and levels of profitability along the way. Just as an investment in an individual company requires careful monitoring, industry analysis is a continuous process that must be repeated over time to identify changes that may be occurring. A useful framework for analyzing the evolution of an industry is an industry life-cycle model, which identifies the sequential stages that an industry typically goes through. The five stages of an industry life cycle according to the Hill and Jones model are: embryonic; growth; shakeout; mature; and decline. Price competition and thinking like a customer are important factors that are often overlooked when analyzing an industry. Whatever factors most influence customer purchasing decisions are also likely to be the focus of competitive rivalry in the industry. Broadly, industries for which price is a large factor in customer purchase decisions tend to be more competitive than industries in which customers value other attributes more highly. External influences on industry growth, profitability, and risk include: technology; demographics; government; and social factors. Company analysis takes place after the analyst has gained an understanding of the company’s external environment and includes answering questions about how the company will respond to the threats and opportunities presented by the external environment. This intended response is the individual company’s competitive strategy. The analyst should seek to determine whether the strategy is primarily defensive or offensive in its nature and how the company intends to implement it. Porter identifies two chief competitive strategies: A low-cost strategy (cost leadership) is one in which companies strive to become the low-cost producers and to gain market share by offering their products and services at lower prices than their competition while still making a profit margin sufficient to generate a superior rate of return based on the higher revenues achieved. A product/service differentiation strategy is one in which companies attempt to establish themselves as the suppliers or producers of products and services that are unique either in quality, type, or means of distribution. To be successful, the companies’ price premiums must be above their costs of differentiation and the differentiation must be appealing to customers and sustainable over time. A checklist for company analysis includes a thorough investigation of: corporate profile; industry characteristics; demand for products/services; supply of products/services; pricing; and financial ratios. Spreadsheet modeling of financial statements to analyze and forecast revenues, operating and net income, and cash flows has become one of the most widely used tools in company analysis. Spreadsheet modeling can be used to quantify the effects of the changes in certain swing factors on the various financial statements. The analyst should be aware that the output of the model will depend significantly on the assumptions that are made.

Beyond the vast global market for public and private fixed-rate bonds, many financial assets and liabilities with known future cash flows you will encounter throughout your career are evaluated using similar principles. This analysis starts with the yield-to-maturity, or internal rate of return on future cash flows, introduced in the fixed-income valuation reading. Fixed-rate bond returns are affected by many factors, the most important of which is the full receipt of all interest and principal payments on scheduled dates. Assuming no default, return is also affected by interest rate changes that affect coupon reinvestment and the bond price if it is sold prior to maturity. Price change measures may be derived from the mathematical relationship used to calculate a bond’s price. Specifically, duration estimates the price change for a given change in interest rates, and convexity improves on the duration estimate by considering that the price and yield-to-maturity relationship of a fixed-rate bond is non-linear. Sources of return on a fixed-rate bond investment include the receipt and reinvestment of coupon payments and either the redemption of principal if the bond is held to maturity or capital gains (or losses) if the bond is sold earlier. Fixed-income investors holding the same bond may have different interest rate risk exposures if their investment horizons differ. We introduce bond duration and convexity, showing how these statistics are calculated and used as interest rate risk measures. Although procedures and formulas exist to calculate duration and convexity, these statistics can be approximated using basic bond-pricing techniques and a financial calculator. Commonly used versions of the statistics are covered, including Macaulay, modified, effective, and key rate durations, and we distinguish between risk measures based on changes in the bond’s yield-to-maturity (i.e., yield duration and convexity) and on benchmark yield curve changes (i.e., curve duration and convexity). We then return to the investment time horizon. When an investor has a short-term horizon, duration and convexity are used to estimate the change in the bond price. Note that yield volatility matters, because bonds with varying times-to-maturity have different degrees of yield volatility. When an investor has a long-term horizon, the interaction between coupon reinvestment risk and market price risk matters. The relationship among interest rate risk, bond duration, and the investment horizon is explored. Finally, we discuss how duration and convexity may be extended to credit and liquidity risks and highlight how these factors can affect a bond’s return and risk. In addition, we highlight the use of statistical methods and historical data to establish empirical as opposed to analytical duration estimates.","The member should be able to: calculate and interpret the sources of return from investing in a fixed-rate bond;<list-type>los</list-type> define, calculate, and interpret Macaulay, modified, and effective durations; explain why effective duration is the most appropriate measure of interest rate risk for bonds with embedded options; define key rate duration and describe the use of key rate durations in measuring the sensitivity of bonds to changes in the shape of the benchmark yield curve; explain how a bond’s maturity, coupon, and yield level affect its interest rate risk; calculate the duration of a portfolio and explain the limitations of portfolio duration; calculate and interpret the money duration of a bond and price value of a basis point (PVBP); calculate and interpret approximate convexity and compare approximate and effective convexity; calculate the percentage price change of a bond for a specified change in yield, given the bond’s approximate duration and convexity; describe how the term structure of yield volatility affects the interest rate risk of a bond; describe the relationships among a bond’s holding period return, its duration, and the investment horizon; explain how changes in credit spread and liquidity affect yield-to-maturity of a bond and how duration and convexity can be used to estimate the price effect of the changes. describe the difference between empirical duration and analytical duration.","This reading covers the risk and return characteristics of fixed-rate bonds. The focus is on the widely used measures of interest rate risk—duration and convexity. These statistics are used extensively in fixed-income analysis. The following are the main points made in the reading: The three sources of return on a fixed-rate bond purchased at par value are: (1) receipt of the promised coupon and principal payments on the scheduled dates, (2) reinvestment of coupon payments, and (3) potential capital gains, as well as losses, on the sale of the bond prior to maturity. For a bond purchased at a discount or premium, the rate of return also includes the effect of the price being “pulled to par” as maturity nears, assuming no default. The total return is the future value of reinvested coupon interest payments and the sale price (or redemption of principal if the bond is held to maturity).The horizon yield (or holding period rate of return) is the internal rate of return between the total return and purchase price of the bond. Coupon reinvestment risk increases with a higher coupon rate and a longer reinvestment time period. Capital gains and losses are measured from the carrying value of the bond and not from the purchase price. The carrying value includes the amortization of the discount or premium if the bond is purchased at a price below or above par value. The carrying value is any point on the constant-yield price trajectory. Interest income on a bond is the return associated with the passage of time. Capital gains and losses are the returns associated with a change in the value of a bond as indicated by a change in the yield-to-maturity. The two types of interest rate risk on a fixed-rate bond are coupon reinvestment risk and market price risk. These risks offset each other to a certain extent. An investor gains from higher rates on reinvested coupons but loses if the bond is sold at a capital loss because the price is below the constant-yield price trajectory. An investor loses from lower rates on reinvested coupon but gains if the bond is sold at a capital gain because the price is above the constant-yield price trajectory. Market price risk dominates coupon reinvestment risk when the investor has a short-term horizon (relative to the time-to-maturity on the bond). Coupon reinvestment risk dominates market price risk when the investor has a long-term horizon (relative to the time-to-maturity)—for instance, a buy-and-hold investor. Bond duration, in general, measures the sensitivity of the full price (including accrued interest) to a change in interest rates. Yield duration statistics measuring the sensitivity of a bond’s full price to the bond’s own yield-to-maturity include the Macaulay duration, modified duration, money duration, and price value of a basis point. Curve duration statistics measuring the sensitivity of a bond’s full price to the benchmark yield curve are usually called “effective durations.” Macaulay duration is the weighted average of the time to receipt of coupon interest and principal payments, in which the weights are the shares of the full price corresponding to each payment. This statistic is annualized by dividing by the periodicity (number of coupon payments or compounding periods in a year). Modified duration provides a linear estimate of the percentage price change for a bond given a change in its yield-to-maturity. Approximate modified duration approaches modified duration as the change in the yield-to-maturity approaches zero. Effective duration is very similar to approximate modified duration. The difference is that approximate modified duration is a yield duration statistic that measures interest rate risk in terms of a change in the bond’s own yield-to-maturity, whereas effective duration is a curve duration statistic that measures interest rate risk assuming a parallel shift in the benchmark yield curve. Key rate duration is a measure of a bond’s sensitivity to a change in the benchmark yield curve at specific maturity segments. Key rate durations can be used to measure a bond’s sensitivity to changes in the shape of the yield curve. Bonds with an embedded option do not have a meaningful internal rate of return because future cash flows are contingent on interest rates. Therefore, effective duration is the appropriate interest rate risk measure, not modified duration. The effective duration of a traditional (option-free) fixed-rate bond is its sensitivity to the benchmark yield curve, which can differ from its sensitivity to its own yield-to-maturity. Therefore, modified duration and effective duration on a traditional (option-free) fixed-rate bond are not necessarily equal. During a coupon period, Macaulay and modified durations decline smoothly in a “saw-tooth” pattern, assuming the yield-to-maturity is constant. When the coupon payment is made, the durations jump upward. Macaulay and modified durations are inversely related to the coupon rate and the yield-to-maturity. Time-to-maturity and Macaulay and modified durations are usually positively related. They are always positively related on bonds priced at par or at a premium above par value. They are usually positively related on bonds priced at a discount below par value. The exception is on long-term, low-coupon bonds, on which it is possible to have a lower duration than on an otherwise comparable shorter-term bond. The presence of an embedded call option reduces a bond’s effective duration compared with that of an otherwise comparable non-callable bond. The reduction in the effective duration is greater when interest rates are low and the issuer is more likely to exercise the call option. The presence of an embedded put option reduces a bond’s effective duration compared with that of an otherwise comparable non-putable bond. The reduction in the effective duration is greater when interest rates are high and the investor is more likely to exercise the put option. The duration of a bond portfolio can be calculated in two ways: (1) the weighted average of the time to receipt of aggregate cash flows and (2) the weighted average of the durations of individual bonds that compose the portfolio. The first method to calculate portfolio duration is based on the cash flow yield, which is the internal rate of return on the aggregate cash flows. It cannot be used for bonds with embedded options or for floating-rate notes. The second method is simpler to use and quite accurate when the yield curve is relatively flat. Its main limitation is that it assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve in that the yields on all bonds in the portfolio change by the same amount. Money duration is a measure of the price change in terms of units of the currency in which the bond is denominated. The price value of a basis point (PVBP) is an estimate of the change in the full price of a bond given a 1 bp change in the yield-to-maturity. Modified duration is the primary, or first-order, effect on a bond’s percentage price change given a change in the yield-to-maturity. Convexity is the secondary, or second-order, effect. It indicates the change in the modified duration as the yield-to-maturity changes. Money convexity is convexity times the full price of the bond. Combined with money duration, money convexity estimates the change in the full price of a bond in units of currency given a change in the yield-to-maturity. Convexity is a positive attribute for a bond. Other things being equal, a more convex bond appreciates in price more than a less convex bond when yields fall and depreciates less when yields rise. Effective convexity is the second-order effect on a bond price given a change in the benchmark yield curve. It is similar to approximate convexity. The difference is that approximate convexity is based on a yield-to-maturity change and effective convexity is based on a benchmark yield curve change. Callable bonds have negative effective convexity when interest rates are low. The increase in price when the benchmark yield is reduced is less in absolute value than the decrease in price when the benchmark yield is raised. The change in a bond price is the product of: (1) the impact per basis-point change in the yield-to-maturity and (2) the number of basis points in the yield change. The first factor is estimated by duration and convexity. The second factor depends on yield volatility. The investment horizon is essential in measuring the interest rate risk on a fixed-rate bond. For a particular assumption about yield volatility, the Macaulay duration indicates the investment horizon for which coupon reinvestment risk and market price risk offset each other. The assumption is a one-time parallel shift to the yield curve in which the yield-to-maturity and coupon reinvestment rates change by the same amount in the same direction. When the investment horizon is greater than the Macaulay duration of the bond, coupon reinvestment risk dominates price risk. The investor’s risk is to lower interest rates. The duration gap is negative. When the investment horizon is equal to the Macaulay duration of the bond, coupon reinvestment risk offsets price risk. The duration gap is zero. When the investment horizon is less than the Macaulay duration of the bond, price risk dominates coupon reinvestment risk. The investor’s risk is to higher interest rates. The duration gap is positive. Credit risk involves the probability of default and degree of recovery if default occurs, whereas liquidity risk refers to the transaction costs associated with selling a bond. For a traditional (option-free) fixed-rate bond, the same duration and convexity statistics apply if a change occurs in the benchmark yield or a change occurs in the spread. The change in the spread can result from a change in credit risk or liquidity risk. In practice, there often is interaction between changes in benchmark yields and in the spread over the benchmark. Empirical duration uses statistical methods and historical bond prices to derive the price–yield relationship for specific bonds or bond portfolios.

Because this work can be both time consuming and data intensive, investors often use a single measure that consolidates this information and reflects the performance of an entire security market. Security market indexes were first introduced as a simple measure to reflect the performance of the US stock market. Since then, security market indexes have evolved into important multi-purpose tools that help investors track the performance of various security markets, estimate risk, and evaluate the performance of investment managers. They also form the basis for new investment products. in·dex , noun ( pl. in·dex·es or in·di·ces ) Latin indic-, index, from indicare to indicate: an indicator, sign, or measure of something. Origin of Market Indexes Investors had access to regularly published data on individual security prices in London as early as 1698, but nearly 200 years passed before they had access to a simple indicator to reflect security market information. To give readers a sense of how the US stock market in general performed on a given day, publishers Charles H. Dow and Edward D. Jones introduced the Dow Jones Average, the world’s first security market index, in 1884. The index, which appeared in The Customers’ Afternoon Letter , consisted of the stocks of nine railroads and two industrial companies. It eventually became the Dow Jones Transportation Average. Convinced that industrial companies, rather than railroads, would be “the great speculative market” of the future, Dow and Jones introduced a second index in May 1896—the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). It had an initial value of 40.94 and consisted of 12 stocks from major US industries. Today, investors can choose from among thousands of indexes to measure and monitor different security markets and asset classes. This reading is organized as follows. Section 2 defines a security market index and explains how to calculate the price return and total return of an index for a single period and over multiple periods. Section 3 describes how indexes are constructed and managed. Section 4 discusses the use of market indexes. Sections 5, 6, and 7 discuss various types of indexes, and the final section summarizes the reading. Practice problems follow the conclusions and summary.","The member should be able to: describe a security market index; calculate and interpret the value, price return, and total return of an index; describe the choices and issues in index construction and management; compare the different weighting methods used in index construction; calculate and analyze the value and return of an index given its weighting method; describe rebalancing and reconstitution of an index; describe uses of security market indexes; describe types of equity indexes; describe types of fixed-income indexes; describe indexes representing alternative investments; compare types of security market indexes.","This reading explains and illustrates the construction, management, and uses of security market indexes. It also discusses various types of indexes. Security market indexes are invaluable tools for investors, who can select from among thousands of indexes representing a variety of security markets, market segments, and asset classes. These indexes range from those representing the global market for major asset classes to those representing alternative investments in specific geographic markets. To benefit from the use of security market indexes, investors must understand their construction and determine whether the selected index is appropriate for their purposes. Frequently, an index that is well suited for one purpose may not be well suited for other purposes. Users of indexes must be familiar with how various indexes are constructed in order to select the index or indexes most appropriate for their needs. Among the key points made in this reading are the following: Security market indexes are intended to measure the values of different target markets (security markets, market segments, or asset classes). The constituent securities selected for inclusion in the security market index are intended to represent the target market. A price return index reflects only the prices of the constituent securities. A total return index reflects not only the prices of the constituent securities but also the reinvestment of all income received since the inception of the index. Methods used to weight the constituents of an index range from the very simple, such as price and equal weightings, to the more complex, such as market-capitalization and fundamental weightings. Choices in index construction—in particular, the choice of weighting method—affect index valuation and returns. Index management includes 1) periodic rebalancing to ensure that the index maintains appropriate weightings and 2) reconstitution to ensure the index represents the desired target market. Rebalancing and reconstitution create turnover in an index. Reconstitution can dramatically affect prices of current and prospective constituents. Indexes serve a variety of purposes. They gauge market sentiment and serve as benchmarks for actively managed portfolios. They act as proxies for measuring systematic risk and risk-adjusted performance. They also serve as proxies for asset classes in asset allocation models and as model portfolios for investment products. Investors can choose from security market indexes representing various asset classes, including equity, fixed-income, commodity, real estate, and hedge fund indexes. Within most asset classes, index providers offer a wide variety of indexes, ranging from broad market indexes to highly specialized indexes based on the issuer’s geographic region, economic development group, or economic sector or other factors. Proper use of security market indexes depends on understanding their construction and management.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level1a/RR_2024_L1V3R2_financial_reporting_quality.pdf,Financial Reporting and Analysis,2024,Level I,"Ideally, analysts would always have access to financial reports that are based on sound financial reporting standards, such as those from the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), and are free from manipulation. But, in practice, the quality of financial reports can vary greatly. High-quality financial reporting provides information that is useful to analysts in assessing a company’s performance and prospects. Low-quality financial reporting contains inaccurate, misleading, or incomplete information. Extreme lapses in financial reporting quality have given rise to high-profile scandals that resulted not only in investor losses but also in reduced confidence in the financial system. Financial statement users who were able to accurately assess financial reporting quality were better positioned to avoid losses. These lapses illustrate the challenges analysts face as well as the potential costs of failing to recognize practices that result in misleading or inaccurate financial reports. Examples of misreporting can provide an analyst with insight into various signals that may indicate poor-quality financial reports. This reading addresses financial reporting quality , which pertains to the quality of information in financial reports, including disclosures in notes. High-quality reporting provides decision-useful information, which is relevant and faithfully represents the economic reality of the company’s activities during the reporting period as well as the company’s financial condition at the end of the period. A separate but interrelated attribute of quality is quality of reported results or earnings quality , which pertains to the earnings and cash generated by the company’s actual economic activities and the resulting financial condition. The term “earnings quality” is commonly used in practice and will be used broadly to encompass the quality of earnings, cash flow, and/or balance sheet items. High-quality earnings result from activities that a company will likely be able to sustain in the future and provide a sufficient return on the company’s investment. The concepts of earnings quality and financial reporting quality are interrelated because a correct assessment of earnings quality is possible only when there is some basic level of financial reporting quality. Beyond this basic level, as the quality of reporting increases, the ability of financial statement users to correctly assess earnings quality and to develop expectations for future performance arguably also increases. Section 2 provides a conceptual overview of reporting quality. Section 3 discusses motivations that might cause, and conditions that might enable, management to issue financial reports that are not high quality and mechanisms that aim to provide discipline to financial reporting quality. Section 4 describes choices made by management that can affect financial reporting quality—presentation choices, accounting methods, and estimates—as well as warning signs of poor-quality financial reporting.","The member should be able to: distinguish between financial reporting quality and quality of reported results (including quality of earnings, cash flow, and balance sheet items); describe a spectrum for assessing financial reporting quality; distinguish between conservative and aggressive accounting; describe motivations that might cause management to issue financial reports that are not high quality; describe conditions that are conducive to issuing low-quality, or even fraudulent, financial reports; describe mechanisms that discipline financial reporting quality and the potential limitations of those mechanisms; describe presentation choices, including non-GAAP measures, that could be used to influence an analyst’s opinion; describe accounting methods (choices and estimates) that could be used to manage earnings, cash flow, and balance sheet items; describe accounting warning signs and methods for detecting manipulation of information in financial reports.","Financial reporting quality varies across companies. The ability to assess the quality of a company’s financial reporting is an important skill for analysts. Indications of low-quality financial reporting can prompt an analyst to maintain heightened skepticism when reading a company’s reports, to review disclosures critically when undertaking financial statement analysis, and to incorporate appropriate adjustments in assessments of past performance and forecasts of future performance. Financial reporting quality can be thought of as spanning a continuum from the highest (containing information that is relevant, correct, complete, and unbiased) to the lowest (containing information that is not just biased or incomplete but possibly pure fabrication). Reporting quality , the focus of this reading, pertains to the information disclosed. High-quality reporting represents the economic reality of the company’s activities during the reporting period and the company’s financial condition at the end of the period. Results quality (commonly referred to as earnings quality) pertains to the earnings and cash generated by the company’s actual economic activities and the resulting financial condition, relative to expectations of current and future financial performance. Quality earnings are regarded as being sustainable, providing a sound platform for forecasts. An aspect of financial reporting quality is the degree to which accounting choices are conservative or aggressive. “Aggressive” typically refers to choices that aim to enhance the company’s reported performance and financial position by inflating the amount of revenues, earnings, and/or operating cash flow reported in the period; or by decreasing expenses for the period and/or the amount of debt reported on the balance sheet. Conservatism in financial reports can result from either (1) accounting standards that specifically require a conservative treatment of a transaction or an event or (2) judgments made by managers when applying accounting standards that result in conservative results. Managers may be motivated to issue less-than-high-quality financial reports in order to mask poor performance, to boost the stock price, to increase personal compensation, and/or to avoid violation of debt covenants. Conditions that are conducive to the issuance of low-quality financial reports include a cultural environment that result in fewer or less transparent financial disclosures, book/tax conformity that shifts emphasis toward legal compliance and away from fair presentation, and limited capital markets regulation. Mechanisms that discipline financial reporting quality include the free market and incentives for companies to minimize cost of capital, auditors, contract provisions specifically tailored to penalize misreporting, and enforcement by regulatory entities. Pro forma earnings (also commonly referred to as non-GAAP or non-IFRS earnings) adjust earnings as reported on the income statement. Pro forma earnings that exclude negative items are a hallmark of aggressive presentation choices. Companies are required to make additional disclosures when presenting any non-GAAP or non-IFRS metric. Managers’ considerable flexibility in choosing their companies’ accounting policies and in formulating estimates provides opportunities for aggressive accounting. Examples of accounting choices that affect earnings and balance sheets include inventory cost flow assumptions, estimates of uncollectible accounts receivable, estimated realizability of deferred tax assets, depreciation method, estimated salvage value of depreciable assets, and estimated useful life of depreciable assets. Cash from operations is a metric of interest to investors that can be enhanced by operating choices, such as stretching accounts payable, and potentially by classification choices.

For example, a decision on the part of households to consume more and to save less can lead to an increase in employment, investment, and ultimately profits. Equally, the investment decisions made by corporations can have an important impact on the real economy and on corporate profits. But individual corporations can rarely affect large economies on their own; the decisions of a single household concerning consumption will have a negligible impact on the wider economy. By contrast, the decisions made by governments can have an enormous impact on even the largest and most developed of economies for two main reasons. First, the public sectors of most developed economies normally employ a significant proportion of the population, and they are usually responsible for a significant proportion of spending in an economy. Second, governments are also the largest borrowers in world debt markets. Government policy is ultimately expressed through its borrowing and spending activities. In this reading, we identify and discuss two types of government policy that can affect the macroeconomy and financial markets: monetary policy and fiscal policy. Monetary policy refers to central bank activities that are directed toward influencing the quantity of money and credit in an economy. By contrast, fiscal policy refers to the government’s decisions about taxation and spending. Both monetary and fiscal policies are used to regulate economic activity over time. They can be used to accelerate growth when an economy starts to slow or to moderate growth and activity when an economy starts to overheat. In addition, fiscal policy can be used to redistribute income and wealth. The overarching goal of both monetary and fiscal policy is normally the creation of an economic environment where growth is stable and positive and inflation is stable and low. Crucially, the aim is therefore to steer the underlying economy so that it does not experience economic booms that may be followed by extended periods of low or negative growth and high levels of unemployment. In such a stable economic environment, householders can feel secure in their consumption and saving decisions, while corporations can concentrate on their investment decisions, on making their regular coupon payments to their bond holders and on making profits for their shareholders. The challenges to achieving this overarching goal are many. Not only are economies frequently buffeted by shocks (such as oil price jumps), but some economists believe that natural cycles in the economy also exist. Moreover, there are plenty of examples from history where government policies—either monetary, fiscal, or both—have exacerbated an economic expansion that eventually led to damaging consequences for the real economy, for financial markets, and for investors. The balance of the reading is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an introduction to monetary policy and related topics. Section 3 presents fiscal policy. The interactions between monetary policy and fiscal policy are the subject of Section 4. A summary and practice problems conclude the reading.","The member should be able to: compare monetary and fiscal policy; describe functions and definitions of money; explain the money creation process; describe theories of the demand for and supply of money; describe the Fisher effect; describe roles and objectives of central banks; contrast the costs of expected and unexpected inflation; describe tools used to implement monetary policy; describe the monetary transmission mechanism; describe qualities of effective central banks; explain the relationships between monetary policy and economic growth, inflation, interest, and exchange rates; contrast the use of inflation, interest rate, and exchange rate targeting by central banks; determine whether a monetary policy is expansionary or contractionary; describe limitations of monetary policy; describe roles and objectives of fiscal policy; describe tools of fiscal policy, including their advantages and disadvantages; describe the arguments about whether the size of a national debt relative to GDP matters; explain the implementation of fiscal policy and difficulties of implementation; determine whether a fiscal policy is expansionary or contractionary; explain the interaction of monetary and fiscal policy.","In this reading, we have sought to explain the practices of both monetary and fiscal policy. Both can have a significant impact on economic activity, and it is for this reason that financial analysts need to be aware of the tools of both monetary and fiscal policy, the goals of the monetary and fiscal authorities, and most important the monetary and fiscal policy transmission mechanisms. Governments can influence the performance of their economies by using combinations of monetary and fiscal policy. Monetary policy refers to central bank activities that are directed toward influencing the quantity of money and credit in an economy. By contrast, fiscal policy refers to the government’s decisions about taxation and spending. The two sets of policies affect the economy via different mechanisms. Money fulfills three important functions: It acts as a medium of exchange, provides individuals with a way of storing wealth, and provides society with a convenient unit of account. Via the process of fractional reserve banking, the banking system can create money. The amount of wealth that the citizens of an economy choose to hold in the form of money—as opposed to, for example, bonds or equities—is known as the demand for money. There are three basic motives for holding money: transactions-related, precautionary, and speculative. The addition of 1 unit of additional reserves to a fractional reserve banking system can support an expansion of the money supply by an amount equal to the money multiplier, defined as 1/reserve requirement (stated as a decimal). The nominal rate of interest is comprised of three components: a real required rate of return, a component to compensate lenders for future inflation, and a risk premium to compensate lenders for uncertainty (e.g., about the future rate of inflation). Central banks take on multiple roles in modern economies. They are usually the monopoly supplier of their currency, the lender of last resort to the banking sector, the government’s bank and bank of the banks, and they often supervise banks. Although they may express their objectives in different ways, the overarching objective of most central banks is price stability. For a central bank to be able to implement monetary policy objectively, it should have a degree of independence from government, be credible, and be transparent in its goals and objectives. The ultimate challenge for central banks as they try to manipulate the supply of money to influence the economy is that they cannot control the amount of money that households and corporations put in banks on deposit, nor can they easily control the willingness of banks to create money by expanding credit. Taken together, this also means that they cannot always control the money supply. Therefore, there are definite limits to the power of monetary policy. The concept of money neutrality is usually interpreted as meaning that money cannot influence the real economy in the long run. However, by the setting of its policy rate, a central bank hopes to influence the real economy via the policy rate’s impact on other market interest rates, asset prices, the exchange rate, and the expectations of economic agents. Inflation targeting is the most common monetary policy—although exchange rate targeting is also used, particularly in developing economies. Quantitative easing attempts to spur aggregate demand by drastically increasing the money supply. Fiscal policy involves the use of government spending and revenue raising (taxation) to impact a number of aspects of the economy: the overall level of aggregate demand in an economy and hence the level of economic activity; the distribution of income and wealth among different segments of the population; and hence ultimately the allocation of resources between different sectors and economic agents. The tools that governments use in implementing fiscal policy are related to the way in which they raise revenue and the different forms of expenditure. Governments usually raise money via a combination of direct and indirect taxes. Government expenditure can be current on goods and services or can take the form of capital expenditure, for example, on infrastructure projects. As economic growth weakens, or when it is in recession, a government can enact an expansionary fiscal policy—for example, by raising expenditure without an offsetting increase in taxation. Conversely, by reducing expenditure and maintaining tax revenues, a contractionary policy might reduce economic activity. Fiscal policy can therefore play an important role in stabilizing an economy. Although both fiscal and monetary policy can alter aggregate demand, they work through different channels, the policies are therefore not interchangeable, and they conceivably can work against one another unless the government and central bank coordinate their objectives.

In essence, an analyst converts data into financial metrics that assist in decision making. Analysts seek to answer such questions as: How successfully has the company performed, relative to its own past performance and relative to its competitors? How is the company likely to perform in the future? Based on expectations about future performance, what is the value of this company or the securities it issues? A primary source of data is a company’s annual report, including the financial statements and notes, and management commentary (operating and financial review or management’s discussion and analysis). This reading focuses on data presented in financial reports prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and United States generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP). However, financial reports do not contain all the information needed to perform effective financial analysis. Although financial statements do contain data about the past performance of a company (its income and cash flows) as well as its current financial condition (assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity), such statements do not necessarily provide all the information useful for analysis nor do they forecast future results. The financial analyst must be capable of using financial statements in conjunction with other information to make projections and reach valid conclusions. Accordingly, an analyst typically needs to supplement the information found in a company’s financial reports with other information, including information on the economy, industry, comparable companies, and the company itself. This reading describes various techniques used to analyze a company’s financial statements. Financial analysis of a company may be performed for a variety of reasons, such as valuing equity securities, assessing credit risk, conducting due diligence related to an acquisition, or assessing a subsidiary’s performance. This reading will describe techniques common to any financial analysis and then discuss more specific aspects for the two most common categories: equity analysis and credit analysis. Equity analysis incorporates an owner’s perspective, either for valuation or performance evaluation. Credit analysis incorporates a creditor’s (such as a banker or bondholder) perspective. In either case, there is a need to gather and analyze information to make a decision (ownership or credit); the focus of analysis varies because of the differing interest of owners and creditors. Both equity and credit analyses assess the entity’s ability to generate and grow earnings, and cash flow, as well as any associated risks. Equity analysis usually places a greater emphasis on growth, whereas credit analysis usually places a greater emphasis on risks. The difference in emphasis reflects the different fundamentals of these types of investments: The value of a company’s equity generally increases as the company’s earnings and cash flow increase, whereas the value of a company’s debt has an upper limit. The balance of this reading is organized as follows: Section 2 recaps the framework for financial statements and the place of financial analysis techniques within the framework. Section 3 provides a description of analytical tools and techniques. Section 4 explains how to compute, analyze, and interpret common financial ratios. Sections 5 through 8 explain the use of ratios and other analytical data in equity analysis, credit analysis, segment analysis, and forecasting, respectively. A summary of the key points and practice problems in the CFA Institute multiple-choice format conclude the reading.","The member should be able to: describe tools and techniques used in financial analysis, including their uses and limitations; classify, calculate, and interpret activity, liquidity, solvency, profitability, and valuation ratios; describe relationships among ratios and evaluate a company using ratio analysis; demonstrate the application of DuPont analysis of return on equity and calculate and interpret effects of changes in its components; calculate and interpret ratios used in equity analysis and credit analysis; explain the requirements for segment reporting and calculate and interpret segment ratios; describe how ratio analysis and other techniques can be used to model and forecast earnings.","Financial analysis techniques, including common-size financial statements and ratio analysis, are useful in summarizing financial reporting data and evaluating the performance and financial position of a company. The results of financial analysis techniques provide important inputs into security valuation. Key facets of financial analysis include the following: Common-size financial statements and financial ratios remove the effect of size, allowing comparisons of a company with peer companies (cross-sectional analysis) and comparison of a company’s results over time (trend or time-series analysis). Activity ratios measure the efficiency of a company’s operations, such as collection of receivables or management of inventory. Major activity ratios include inventory turnover, days of inventory on hand, receivables turnover, days of sales outstanding, payables turnover, number of days of payables, working capital turnover, fixed asset turnover, and total asset turnover. Liquidity ratios measure the ability of a company to meet short-term obligations. Major liquidity ratios include the current ratio, quick ratio, cash ratio, and defensive interval ratio. Solvency ratios measure the ability of a company to meet long-term obligations. Major solvency ratios include debt ratios (including the debt-to-assets ratio, debt-to-capital ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and financial leverage ratio) and coverage ratios (including interest coverage and fixed charge coverage). Profitability ratios measure the ability of a company to generate profits from revenue and assets. Major profitability ratios include return on sales ratios (including gross profit margin, operating profit margin, pretax margin, and net profit margin) and return on investment ratios (including operating ROA, ROA, return on total capital, ROE, and return on common equity). Ratios can also be combined and evaluated as a group to better understand how they fit together and how efficiency and leverage are tied to profitability. ROE can be analyzed as the product of the net profit margin, asset turnover, and financial leverage. This decomposition is sometimes referred to as DuPont analysis. Valuation ratios express the relation between the market value of a company or its equity (for example, price per share) and some fundamental financial metric (for example, earnings per share). Ratio analysis is useful in the selection and valuation of debt and equity securities and is a part of the credit rating process. Ratios can also be computed for business segments to evaluate how units within a business are performing. The results of financial analysis provide valuable inputs into forecasts of future earnings and cash flow.

As different market structures result in different sets of choices facing a firm’s decision makers, an understanding of market structure is a powerful tool in analyzing issues such as a firm’s pricing of its products and, more broadly, its potential to increase profitability. In the long run, a firm’s profitability will be determined by the forces associated with the market structure within which it operates. In a highly competitive market, long-run profits will be driven down by the forces of competition. In less competitive markets, large profits are possible even in the long run; in the short run, any outcome is possible. Therefore, understanding the forces behind the market structure will aid the financial analyst in determining firms’ short- and long-term prospects. Section 2 introduces the analysis of market structures. The section addresses questions such as: What determines the degree of competition associated with each market structure? Given the degree of competition associated with each market structure, what decisions are left to the management team developing corporate strategy? How does a chosen pricing and output strategy evolve into specific decisions that affect the profitability of the firm? The answers to these questions are related to the forces of the market structure within which the firm operates. Sections 3, 4, 5, and 6 analyze demand, supply, optimal price and output, and factors affecting long-run equilibrium for perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and pure monopoly, respectively. Section 7 reviews techniques for identifying the various forms of market structure. For example, there are accepted measures of market concentration that are used by regulators of financial institutions to judge whether or not a planned merger or acquisition will harm the competitive nature of regional banking markets. Financial analysts should be able to identify the type of market structure a firm is operating within. Each different structure implies a different long-run sustainability of profits. A summary and practice problems conclude the reading.","The member should be able to: describe characteristics of perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and pure monopoly; explain relationships between price, marginal revenue, marginal cost, economic profit, and the elasticity of demand under each market structure; describe a firm’s supply function under each market structure; describe and determine the optimal price and output for firms under each market structure; explain factors affecting long-run equilibrium under each market structure; describe pricing strategy under each market structure; describe the use and limitations of concentration measures in identifying market structure; identify the type of market structure within which a firm operates.","In this reading, we have surveyed how economists classify market structures. We have analyzed the distinctions between the different structures that are important for understanding demand and supply relations, optimal price and output, and the factors affecting long-run profitability. We also provided guidelines for identifying market structure in practice. Among our conclusions are the following: Economic market structures can be grouped into four categories: perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and monopoly. The categories differ because of the following characteristics: The number of producers is many in perfect and monopolistic competition, few in oligopoly, and one in monopoly. The degree of product differentiation, the pricing power of the producer, the barriers to entry of new producers, and the level of non-price competition (e.g., advertising) are all low in perfect competition, moderate in monopolistic competition, high in oligopoly, and generally highest in monopoly. A financial analyst must understand the characteristics of market structures in order to better forecast a firm’s future profit stream. The optimal marginal revenue equals marginal cost. However, only in perfect competition does the marginal revenue equal price. In the remaining structures, price generally exceeds marginal revenue because a firm can sell more units only by reducing the per unit price. The quantity sold is highest in perfect competition. The price in perfect competition is usually lowest, but this depends on factors such as demand elasticity and increasing returns to scale (which may reduce the producer’s marginal cost). Monopolists, oligopolists, and producers in monopolistic competition attempt to differentiate their products so that they can charge higher prices. Typically, monopolists sell a smaller quantity at a higher price. Investors may benefit from being shareholders of monopolistic firms that have large margins and substantial positive cash flows. Competitive firms do not earn economic profit. There will be a market compensation for the rental of capital and of management services, but the lack of pricing power implies that there will be no extra margins. While in the short run firms in any market structure can have economic profits, the more competitive a market is and the lower the barriers to entry, the faster the extra profits will fade. In the long run, new entrants shrink margins and push the least efficient firms out of the market. Oligopoly is characterized by the importance of strategic behavior. Firms can change the price, quantity, quality, and advertisement of the product to gain an advantage over their competitors. Several types of equilibrium (e.g., Nash, Cournot, kinked demand curve) may occur that affect the likelihood of each of the incumbents (and potential entrants in the long run) having economic profits. Price wars may be started to force weaker competitors to abandon the market. Measuring market power is complicated. Ideally, econometric estimates of the elasticity of demand and supply should be computed. However, because of the lack of reliable data and the fact that elasticity changes over time (so that past data may not apply to the current situation), regulators and economists often use simpler measures. The concentration ratio is simple, but the HHI, with little more computation required, often produces a better figure for decision making.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V2R1-topics-demand-supply-analysis.pdf,Economics,2023,Level I,"In a general sense, economics is the study of production, distribution, and consumption and can be divided into two broad areas of study: macroeconomics and microeconomics. Macroeconomics deals with aggregate economic quantities, such as national output and national income, and is rooted in microeconomics , which deals with markets and decision making of individual economic units, including consumers and businesses. Microeconomics is a logical starting point for the study of economics. Microeconomics classifies private economic units into two groups: consumers (or households) and firms. These two groups give rise, respectively, to the theory of the consumer and the theory of the firm as two branches of study. The theory of the consumer deals with consumption (the demand for goods and services) by utility-maximizing individuals (i.e., individuals who make decisions that maximize the satisfaction received from present and future consumption). The theory of the firm deals with the supply of goods and services by profit-maximizing firms. It is expected that candidates will be familiar with the basic concepts of demand and supply. This material is covered in detail in the recommended prerequisite readings. In this reading, we will explore how buyers and sellers interact to determine transaction prices and quantities. The reading is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the consumer or demand side of the market model, and Section 3 discusses the supply side of the consumer goods market, paying particular attention to the firm’s costs. Section 4 provides a summary of key points in the reading.","The member should be able to: calculate and interpret price, income, and cross-price elasticities of demand and describe factors that affect each measure; compare substitution and income effects; distinguish between normal goods and inferior goods; describe the phenomenon of diminishing marginal returns; determine and interpret breakeven and shutdown points of production; describe how economies of scale and diseconomies of scale affect costs.","This reading addressed several important concepts that extend the basic market model of demand and supply to assist the analyst in assessing a firm’s breakeven and shutdown points of production. Demand concepts covered include own-price elasticity of demand, cross-price elasticity of demand, and income elasticity of demand. Supply concepts covered include total, average, and marginal product of labor; total, variable, and marginal cost of labor; and total and marginal revenue. These concepts are used to calculate the breakeven and shutdown points of production. Elasticity of demand is a measure of how sensitive quantity demanded is to changes in various variables. Own-price elasticity of demand is the ratio of percentage change in quantity demanded to percentage change in a good or service’s own price. If own-price elasticity of demand is greater than one in absolute terms, demand is elastic and a decline in price will result in higher total expenditure on that good. If own-price elasticity of demand is less than one in absolute terms, demand is inelastic and a decline in price will result in a lower total expenditure on that good. If own-price elasticity of demand is equal to negative one, demand is unit, or unitary, elastic and total expenditure on that good is independent of price. Own-price elasticity of demand will almost always be negative. Income elasticity of demand is the ratio of the percentage change in quantity demanded to the percentage change in consumer income. Demand is negatively sloped because of either the substitution effect or the income effect. The substitution effect is the phenomenon in which, as a good’s price falls, more of this good is substituted for other, more expensive goods. The income effect is the phenomenon in which, as a good’s price falls, real income rises and, if this good is normal, more of it will be purchased. If the good is inferior, the income effect will partially or fully offset the substitution effect. There are two exceptions to the law of demand: Giffen goods and Veblen goods. Giffen goods are highly inferior and make up a large portion of the consumer budget. As price falls, the substitution effect tends to cause more of the good to be consumed, but the highly negative income effect overwhelms the substitution effect. Demand curves for Giffen goods are positively sloped. Veblen goods are highly valued high-priced “status” goods; consumers may tend to buy more of a good if its price rises. If income elasticity of demand is positive, the good is a normal good. If income elasticity of demand is negative, the good is an inferior good. Cross-price elasticity of demand is the ratio of the percentage change in quantity demanded of one good to the percentage change in the price of a related good. If cross-price elasticity between two goods is positive, they are substitutes, and if cross-price elasticity between two goods is negative, they are complements. The law of demand states that a decrease in price will cause an increase in quantity demanded. Total product of labor is a short-run concept that is the total quantity that is able to be produced for each level of labor input, holding all other inputs constant. Average product of labor (APL) is the total product of labor divided by number of labor hours. Marginal product of labor (MP L ) is the change in total product divided by the change in labor hours. MP L might rise as more labor is added to a fixed amount of capital. The law of diminishing returns dictates that additional output must fall as more and more labor is added to a fixed amount of capital. Production costs increase as input prices rise and fall as inputs become more productive. Short-run total cost (STC) is the total expenditure on fixed capital plus the total expenditure on labor. Short-run marginal cost (SMC) equals the ratio of wage to marginal product of labor (MP L ). Average variable cost (AVC) is the ratio of wage to average product of labor (APL). Average total cost (ATC) is total cost (TC) divided by the number of units produced. Revenue is price times quantity sold. Marginal revenue (MR) is the ratio of change in revenue to change in output. Firms under conditions of perfect competition have no pricing power and, therefore, face a perfectly horizontal demand curve at the market price. For firms under conditions of perfect competition, price is identical to marginal revenue (MR). Firms under conditions of imperfect competition face a negatively sloped demand curve and have pricing power. For firms under conditions of imperfect competition, marginal revenue (MR) is less than price. Economic profit equals total revenue (TR) minus total economic cost, whereas accounting profit equals TR minus total accounting cost. Economic cost takes into account the total opportunity cost of all factors of production. Opportunity cost is the next best alternative forgone in making a decision. Maximum economic profit requires that (1) marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC) and (2) MC not be falling with output. The breakeven point occurs when total revenue (TR) equals total cost (TC), otherwise stated as the output quantity at which average total cost (ATC) equals price. Shutdown occurs when a firm is better off not operating than continuing to operate. If all fixed costs are sunk costs, then shutdown occurs when the market price falls below minimum average variable cost. After shutdown, the firm incurs only fixed costs and loses less money than it would operating at a price that does not cover variable costs. In the short run, it may be rational for a firm to continue to operate while earning negative economic profit if some unavoidable fixed costs are covered. Economies of scale is defined as decreasing long-run cost per unit as output increases. Diseconomies of scale is defined as increasing long-run cost per unit as output increases. Long-run average total cost is the cost of production per unit of output under conditions in which all inputs are variable. Specialization efficiencies and bargaining power in input price can lead to economies of scale. Bureaucratic and communication breakdowns and bottlenecks that raise input prices can lead to diseconomies of scale. The minimum point on the long-run average total cost curve defines the minimum efficient scale for the firm.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level1a/RR_2024_L1V1R13_understanding_business_cycles.pdf,Economics,2024,Level I,"A typical economy’s output of goods and services fluctuates around its longer-term path. We now turn our attention to those recurring, cyclical fluctuations in economic output. Some of the factors that influence short-term changes in the economy—such as changes in population, technology, and capital—are the same as those that affect long-term sustainable economic growth. But forces that cause shifts in aggregate demand and aggregate supply curves—such as expectations, political developments, natural disasters, and fiscal and monetary policy decisions—influence economies particularly in the short run. We first describe a typical business cycle and its phases. While each cycle is different, analysts and investors need to be familiar with the typical cycle phases and what they mean for the expectations and decisions of businesses and households that influence the performance of sectors and companies. These behaviors also impact financial conditions and risk appetite, thus impacting the setting of expectations and choices of portfolio exposures to different investment sectors or styles. In the sections that follow, we describe credit cycles, introduce several theories of business cycles, and explain how different economic schools of thought interpret the business cycle and their recommendations with respect to it. We also discuss variables that demonstrate predictable relationships with the economy, focusing on those whose movements have value in predicting the future course of the economy. We then proceed to explain measures and features of unemployment and inflation.","The member should be able to: describe the business cycle and its phases; describe credit cycles; describe how resource use, consumer and business activity, housing sector activity, and external trade sector activity vary as an economy moves through the business cycle; describe theories of the business cycle; interpret a set of economic indicators, and describe their uses and limitations; describe types of unemployment, and compare measures of unemployment; explain inflation, hyperinflation, disinflation, and deflation; explain the construction of indexes used to measure inflation; compare inflation measures, including their uses and limitations; contrast cost-push and demand-pull inflation.","Business cycles are recurrent expansions and contractions in economic activity affecting broad segments of the economy. Business cycles are a fundamental feature of market economies, but their amplitude and/or length vary considerably. Business cycles can be split into many different phases. The investment industry typically refers to four phases of the cycle: recovery, expansion, slowdown, and contraction, with the peak output occurring during the slowdown phase and the trough in output occurring in the recovery phase. Classical cycle refers to fluctuations in the level of economic activity when measured by GDP in volume terms. Growth cycle refers to fluctuations in economic activity around the long-term potential trend growth level with focus on how much actual economic activity is below or above trend growth in economic activity. Growth rate cycle refers to fluctuations in the growth rate of economic activity. Credit cycles describe the changing availability—and pricing—of credit. When the economy is strong or improving, the willingness of lenders to extend credit, and on favorable terms, is high. When the economy is weak or weakening, lenders pull back, or “tighten” credit, by making it less available and more expensive, contributing to asset values and further economic weakness and higher defaults. Credit cycles are relevant due to the importance of credit in the financing of construction and the purchase of property. The extent of business cycle fluctuations and the duration of recessions and recoveries are often shaped by linkages between business and credit cycles. Key economic variables change through the business cycle. The level of business investment shows significant changes over the cycle. Employment levels follow the cycle with a delay as companies initially use overtime before hiring after the onset of recovery and then reduce overtime before reducing employment as the economy passes its peak and enters contraction. Consumer spending, the largest component of output, follows cyclical patterns as workers make decisions based on their levels of income, wage growth, and employment outlook. Spending on consumer durables is the most cyclical consumer activity, followed by services and consumer staples, which are less affected by the cyclicality of the economy. The size of inventories is small relative to the size of the economy, but they have a much greater effect on economic growth than justified by their relatively small aggregate size relative to the economy as a whole. Inventory–sales ratio measures the inventories available for sale to the level of sales. Analysts pay attention to inventories to gauge the position of the economy in the cycle. Neoclassical and Real Business Cycle (RBC) theories focus on fluctuations of aggregate supply (AS). If AS shifts left because of an input price increase or right because of a price decrease or technical progress, the economy will gradually converge to its new equilibrium. Government intervention is generally not necessary because it may exacerbate the fluctuation or delay the convergence to equilibrium. Keynesian theories focus on fluctuations of aggregate demand (AD). If AD shifts left, Keynesians advocate government intervention to restore full employment and avoid a deflationary spiral. Monetarists argue that the timing of the impact from government policies is uncertain, and it is generally better to let the economy find its new equilibrium unassisted while ensuring that the money supply is kept growing at an even pace. Economic indicators are statistics on macroeconomic variables that help in understanding which stage of the business cycle an economy is at. Of particular importance are the leading indicators, which suggest where the economy is likely to be in the near future. No economic indicator is perfect, and many of these statistics are subject to periodic revisions. Leading economic indicators have turning points that usually precede those of the overall economy. They include survey-based indicators, such as (ISM), new orders, and average consumer expectations. They also include average weekly hours, initial claims for unemployment insurance, new building permits, the stock market index, and the difference between yields on short-term and long-term bonds. Coincident economic indicators have turning points that are usually close to those of the overall economy. They are believed to have value for identifying the economy’s present state. They include industrial production indexes, manufacturing and trade sales indexes, aggregate real personal income, and non-agricultural employment. Lagging economic indicators have turning points that take place later than those of the overall economy; they change after a trend has been established. They include average duration of unemployment, inventory–sales ratio, change in unit labor costs, average bank prime lending rate, commercial and industrial loans outstanding, ratio of consumer installment debt to income, and change in consumer price index for services. Policy makers and market practitioners use real-time monitoring of economic and financial variables to continuously assess current conditions and produce a nowcast. Nowcasting produces an estimate of the present state of the economy. It is useful because the actual data on such measures as GDP are only published with delay, after the end of the time period under consideration. Unemployed are those people who are actively seeking employment but are currently without a job. Long-term unemployed are those who have been out of work for a long time (more than three to four months in many countries) but are still looking for a job. Frictionally unemployed are those people who are not working at the time of filling out the statistical survey because they are taking time to search for a job that matches their skills, interests, and other preferences better than what is currently available, or people who have left one job and are about to start another job. There are different types of inflation. Hyperinflation indicates a high (e.g., 100% annual) and increasing rate of inflation; deflation indicates a negative inflation rate (prices decrease); imported inflation is associated with increasing cost of inputs that come from abroad; demand inflation is caused by constraints in production that prevent companies from making as many goods as the market demands (it is sometimes called wartime inflation, because in times of war, goods tend to be rationed). Inflation is measured by many indexes. Consumer price indexes reflect the prices of a basket of goods and services that is typically purchased by a normal household. Producer price indexes measure the cost of a basket of raw materials, intermediate inputs, and finished products. GDP deflators measure the price of the basket of goods and services produced within an economy in a given year. Core indexes exclude volatile items, such as agricultural products and energy, whose prices tend to vary more than other goods. Price levels are affected by real factors and monetary factors. Real factors include aggregate supply (an increase in supply leads to lower prices) and aggregate demand (an increase in demand leads to higher prices). Monetary factors include the supply of money (i.e., more money circulating, if the economy is in equilibrium, will lead to higher prices) and the velocity of money (i.e., higher velocity, if the economy is in equilibrium, will lead to higher prices). Economists describe two types of inflation: cost-push, in which rising costs, usually wages, compel businesses to raise prices generally; and demand-pull, in which increasing demand raises prices generally, which then are reflected in a business’s costs as workers demand wake hikes to catch up with the rising cost of living.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V2R7-international-trade-capital-flows.pdf,Economics,2023,Level I,"Global investors must address two fundamentally interrelated questions: where to invest and in what asset classes? Some countries may be attractive from an equity perspective because of their strong economic growth and the profitability of particular domestic sectors or industries. Other countries may be attractive from a fixed income perspective because of their interest rate environment and price stability. To identify markets that are expected to provide attractive investment opportunities, investors must analyze cross-country differences in such factors as expected GDP growth rates, monetary and fiscal policies, trade policies, and competitiveness. From a longer term perspective investors also need to consider such factors as a country’s stage of economic and financial market development, demographics, quality and quantity of physical and human capital (accumulated education and training of workers), and its area(s) of comparative advantage. This reading provides a framework for analyzing a country’s trade and capital flows and their economic implications. International trade can facilitate economic growth by increasing the efficiency of resource allocation, providing access to larger capital and product markets, and facilitating specialization based on comparative advantage. The flow of financial capital (funds available for investment) between countries with excess savings and those where financial capital is scarce can increase liquidity, raise output, and lower the cost of capital. From an investment perspective, it is important to understand the complex and dynamic nature of international trade and capital flows because investment opportunities are increasingly exposed to the forces of global competition for markets, capital, and ideas. This reading is organized as follows. Section 2 defines basic terminology used in the reading and describes patterns and trends in international trade and capital flows. It also discusses the benefits of international trade, distinguishes between absolute and comparative advantage, and explains two traditional models of comparative advantage. Section 3 describes trade restrictions and their implications and discusses the motivation for, and advantages of, trade agreements. Section 4 describes the balance of payments and Section 5 discusses the function and objectives of international organizations that facilitate trade. A summary of key points and practice problems conclude the reading.","The member should be able to: compare gross domestic product and gross national product; describe benefits and costs of international trade; distinguish between comparative advantage and absolute advantage; compare the Ricardian and Heckscher-Ohlin models of trade and the source(s) of comparative advantage in each model; compare types of trade and capital restrictions and their economic implications; explain motivations for and advantages of trading blocs, common markets, and economic unions; describe common objectives of capital restrictions imposed by governments; describe the balance of payments accounts including their components; explain how decisions by consumers, firms, and governments affect the balance of payments; describe functions and objectives of the international organizations that facilitate trade, including the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organization.","This reading provides a framework for analyzing a country’s trade and capital flows and their economic implications. It examines basic models that explain trade based on comparative advantage and provides a basis for understanding how international trade can affect the rate and composition of economic growth as well as the attractiveness of investment in various sectors. The benefits of trade include gains from exchange and specialization; gains from economies of scale as companies add new markets for their products; greater variety of products available to households and firms; and increased competition and more efficient allocation of resources. A country has an absolute advantage in producing a good (or service) if it is able to produce that good at a lower absolute cost or use fewer resources in its production than its trading partner. A country has a comparative advantage in producing a good if its opportunity cost of producing that good is less than that of its trading partner. Even if a country does not have an absolute advantage in the production of any good, it can gain from trade by producing and exporting the good(s) in which it has a comparative advantage and importing good(s) in which it has a comparative disadvantage. In the Ricardian model of trade, comparative advantage and the pattern of trade are determined by differences in technology between countries. In the Heckscher–Ohlin model of trade, comparative advantage and the pattern of trade are determined by differences in factor endowments between countries. In reality, technology and factor endowments are complementary, not mutually exclusive, determinants of trade patterns. Trade barriers prevent the free flow of goods and services among countries. Governments impose trade barriers for various reasons including: to promote specific developmental objectives, to counteract certain imperfections in the functioning of markets, or to respond to problems facing their economies. For purposes of international trade policy and analysis, a small country is defined as one that cannot affect the world price of traded goods. A large country’s production and/or consumption decisions do alter the relative prices of trade goods. In a small country, trade barriers generate a net welfare loss arising from distortion of production and consumption decisions and the associated inefficient allocation of resources. Trade barriers can generate a net welfare gain in a large country if the gain from improving its terms of trade (higher export prices and lower import prices) more than offsets the loss from the distortion of resource allocations. However, the large country can only gain if it imposes an even larger welfare loss on its trading partner(s). An import tariff and an import quota have the same effect on price, production, and trade. With a quota, however, some or all of the revenue that would be raised by the equivalent tariff is instead captured by foreign producers (or the foreign government) as quota rents. Thus, the welfare loss suffered by the importing country is generally greater with a quota. A voluntary export restraint is imposed by the exporting country. It has the same impact on the importing country as an import quota from which foreigners capture all of the quota rents. An export subsidy encourages firms to export their product rather than sell it in the domestic market. The distortion of production, consumption, and trade decisions generates a welfare loss. The welfare loss is greater for a large country because increased production and export of the subsidized product reduces its global price—that is, worsens the country’s terms of trade. Capital restrictions are defined as controls placed on foreigners’ ability to own domestic assets and/or domestic residents’ ability to own foreign assets. In contrast to trade restrictions, which limit the openness of goods markets, capital restrictions limit the openness of financial markets. A regional trading bloc is a group of countries who have signed an agreement to reduce and progressively eliminate barriers to trade and movement of factors of production among the members of the bloc. They may or may not have common trade barriers against those countries that are not members of the bloc. In a free trade area all barriers to the flow of goods and services among members are eliminated, but each country maintains its own polices against non-members. A customs union extends the FTA by not only allowing free movement of goods and services among members but also creating a common trade policy against non-members. A common market incorporates all aspects of a customs union and extends it by allowing free movement of factors of production among members. An economic union incorporates all aspects of a common market and requires common economic institutions and coordination of economic policies among members. Members of a monetary union adopt a common currency. From an investment perspective, it is important to understand the complex and dynamic nature of trading relationships because they can help identify potential profitable investment opportunities as well as provide some advance warning signals regarding when to disinvest in a market or industry. The major components of the balance of payments are the current account balance, which largely reflects trade in goods and services. capital account balance, which mainly consists of capital transfers and net sales of non-produced, non-financial assets. financial account, which measures net capital flows based on sales and purchases of domestic and foreign financial assets. Decisions by consumers, firms, and governments influence the balance of payments. Low private savings and/or high investment tend to produce a current account deficit that must be financed by net capital imports; high private savings and/or low investment, however, produce a current account surplus, balanced by net capital exports. All else the same, a government deficit produces a current account deficit and a government surplus leads to a current account surplus. All else the same, a sustained current account deficit contributes to a rise in the risk premium for financial assets of the deficit country. Current account surplus countries tend to enjoy lower risk premiums than current account deficit countries. Created after WWII, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization are the three major international organizations that provide necessary stability to the international monetary system and facilitate international trade and development. The IMF’s mission is to ensure the stability of the international monetary system, the system of exchange rates and international payments that enables countries to buy goods and services from each other. The IMF helps to keep country-specific market risk and global systemic risk under control. The World Bank helps to create the basic economic infrastructure essential for creation and maintenance of domestic financial markets and a well-functioning financial industry in developing countries. The World Trade Organization’s mission is to foster free trade by providing a major institutional and regulatory framework of global trade rules without which today’s global multinational corporations would be hard to conceive.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V4R12-introduction-fixed-income-valuation.pdf,Fixed Income,2023,Level I,"Globally, the fixed-income market is a key source of financing for businesses and governments. In fact, the total market value outstanding of corporate and government bonds is significantly larger than that of equity securities. Similarly, the fixed-income market, which is also called the debt market or bond market, represents a significant investing opportunity for institutions as well as individuals. Pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies, and sovereign wealth funds, among others, are major fixed-income investors. Retirees who desire a relatively stable income stream often hold fixed-income securities. Clearly, understanding how to value fixed-income securities is important to investors, issuers, and financial analysts. We focus on the valuation of traditional (option-free) fixed-rate bonds, although other debt securities, such as floating-rate notes and money market instruments, are also covered. We first describe and illustrate basic bond valuation, which includes pricing a bond using a market discount rate for each of the future cash flows and pricing a bond using a series of spot rates. Valuation using spot rates allows for each future cash flow to be discounted at a rate associated with its timing. This valuation methodology for future cash flows has applications well beyond the fixed-income market. Relationships among a bond’s price, coupon rate, maturity, and market discount rate (yield-to-maturity) are also described and illustrated. We then turn our attention to how bond prices and yields are quoted and calculated in practice. When bonds are actively traded, investors can observe the price and calculate various yield measures. However, these yield measures differ by the type of bond. In practice, different measures are used for fixed-rate bonds, floating-rate notes, and money market instruments. We then discuss the maturity or term structure of interest rates, involving an analysis of yield curves, which illustrates the relationship between yields-to-maturity and times-to-maturity on bonds with otherwise similar characteristics. Lastly, we describe yield spreads, measures of how much additional yield over the benchmark security (usually a government bond) investors expect for bearing additional risk.","The member should be able to: calculate a bond’s price given a market discount rate; identify the relationships among a bond’s price, coupon rate, maturity, and market discount rate (yield-to-maturity); define spot rates and calculate the price of a bond using spot rates; describe and calculate the flat price, accrued interest, and the full price of a bond; describe matrix pricing; calculate annual yield on a bond for varying compounding periods in a year; calculate and interpret yield measures for fixed-rate bonds and floating-rate notes; calculate and interpret yield measures for money market instruments; define and compare the spot curve, yield curve on coupon bonds, par curve, and forward curve; define forward rates and calculate spot rates from forward rates, forward rates from spot rates, and the price of a bond using forward rates; compare, calculate, and interpret yield spread measures.","We have covered the principles and techniques that are used in the valuation of fixed-rate bonds, as well as floating-rate notes and money market instruments. These building blocks are used extensively in fixed-income analysis. The following are the main points made: The market discount rate is the rate of return required by investors given the risk of the investment in the bond. A bond is priced at a premium above par value when the coupon rate is greater than the market discount rate. A bond is priced at a discount below par value when the coupon rate is less than the market discount rate. The amount of any premium or discount is the present value of the “excess” or “deficiency” in the coupon payments relative to the yield-to-maturity. The yield-to-maturity, the internal rate of return on the cash flows, is the implied market discount rate given the price of the bond. A bond price moves inversely with its market discount rate. The relationship between a bond price and its market discount rate is convex. The price of a lower-coupon bond is more volatile than the price of a higher-coupon bond, other things being equal. Generally, the price of a longer-term bond is more volatile than the price of a shorter-term bond, other things being equal. An exception to this phenomenon can occur on low-coupon (but not zero-coupon) bonds that are priced at a discount to par value. Assuming no default, premium and discount bond prices are “pulled to par” as maturity nears. A spot rate is the yield-to-maturity on a zero-coupon bond. A yield-to-maturity can be approximated as a weighted average of the underlying spot rates. Between coupon dates, the full (or invoice, or “dirty”) price of a bond is split between the flat (or quoted, or “clean”) price and the accrued interest. Flat prices are quoted to not misrepresent the daily increase in the full price as a result of interest accruals. Accrued interest is calculated as a proportional share of the next coupon payment using either the actual/actual or 30/360 methods to count days. Matrix pricing is used to value illiquid bonds by using prices and yields on comparable securities having the same or similar credit risk, coupon rate, and maturity. The periodicity of an annual interest rate is the number of periods in the year. A yield quoted on a semiannual bond basis is an annual rate for a periodicity of two. It is the yield per semiannual period times two. The general rule for periodicity conversions is that compounding more frequently at a lower annual rate corresponds to compounding less frequently at a higher annual rate. Street convention yields assume payments are made on scheduled dates, neglecting weekends and holidays.The current yield is the annual coupon payment divided by the flat price, thereby neglecting as a measure of the investor’s rate of return the time value of money, any accrued interest, and the gain from buying at a discount or the loss from buying at a premium. The simple yield is like the current yield but includes the straight-line amortization of the discount or premium. The yield-to-worst on a callable bond is the lowest of the yield-to-first-call, yield-to-second-call, and so on, calculated using the call price for the future value and the call date for the number of periods. The option-adjusted yield on a callable bond is the yield-to-maturity after adding the theoretical value of the call option to the price. A floating-rate note (floater, or FRN) maintains a more stable price than a fixed-rate note because interest payments adjust for changes in market interest rates. The quoted margin on a floater is typically the specified yield spread over or under the reference rate, which we refer to as the Market Reference Rate. The discount margin on a floater is the spread required by investors, and to which the quoted margin must be set, for the FRN to trade at par value on a rate reset date. Money market instruments, having one year or less time-to-maturity, are quoted on a discount rate or add-on rate basis. Money market discount rates understate the investor’s rate of return (and the borrower’s cost of funds) because the interest income is divided by the face value or the total amount redeemed at maturity, and not by the amount of the investment. Money market instruments need to be converted to a common basis for analysis. A money market bond equivalent yield is an add-on rate for a 365-day year. The periodicity of a money market instrument is the number of days in the year divided by the number of days to maturity. Therefore, money market instruments with different times-to-maturity have annual rates for different periodicities. In theory, the maturity structure, or term structure, of interest rates is the relationship between yields-to-maturity and times-to-maturity on bonds having the same currency, credit risk, liquidity, tax status, and periodicity. A spot curve is a series of yields-to-maturity on zero-coupon bonds. A frequently used yield curve is a series of yields-to-maturity on coupon bonds. A par curve is a series of yields-to-maturity assuming the bonds are priced at par value. In a cash market, the delivery of the security and cash payment is made on a settlement date within a customary time period after the trade date—for example, “T + 3.” In a forward market, the delivery of the security and cash payment are made on a predetermined future date. A forward rate is the interest rate on a bond or money market instrument traded in a forward market. An implied forward rate (or forward yield) is the breakeven reinvestment rate linking the return on an investment in a shorter-term zero-coupon bond to the return on an investment in a longer-term zero-coupon bond. An implied forward curve can be calculated from the spot curve. Implied spot rates can be calculated as geometric averages of forward rates. A fixed-income bond can be valued using a market discount rate, a series of spot rates, or a series of forward rates. A bond yield-to-maturity can be separated into a benchmark and a spread. Changes in benchmark rates capture macroeconomic factors that affect all bonds in the market—inflation, economic growth, foreign exchange rates, and monetary and fiscal policy. Changes in spreads typically capture microeconomic factors that affect the particular bond—credit risk, liquidity, and tax effects. Benchmark rates are usually yields-to-maturity on government bonds or fixed rates on interest rate swaps. A G-spread is the spread over or under a government bond rate, and an I-spread is the spread over or under an interest rate swap rate. A G-spread or an I-spread can be based on a specific benchmark rate or on a rate interpolated from the benchmark yield curve. A Z-spread (zero-volatility spread) is based on the entire benchmark spot curve. It is the constant spread that is added to each spot rate such that the present value of the cash flows matches the price of the bond. An option-adjusted spread (OAS) on a callable bond is the Z-spread minus the theoretical value of the embedded call option.

For example, the analyst may want to know whether earnings growth, or perhaps cash flow growth, helps explain the company’s value in the marketplace. Regression analysis is a tool for examining this type of issue.","The member should be able to: describe a simple linear regression model and the roles of the dependent and independent variables in the model; describe the least squares criterion, how it is used to estimate regression coefficients, and their interpretation; explain the assumptions underlying the simple linear regression model, and describe how residuals and residual plots indicate if these assumptions may have been violated; calculate and interpret the coefficient of determination and the F -statistic in a simple linear regression; describe the use of analysis of variance (ANOVA) in regression analysis, interpret ANOVA results, and calculate and interpret the standard error of estimate in a simple linear regression; formulate a null and an alternative hypothesis about a population value of a regression coefficient, and determine whether the null hypothesis is rejected at a given level of significance; calculate and interpret the predicted value for the dependent variable, and a prediction interval for it, given an estimated linear regression model and a value for the independent variable; describe different functional forms of simple linear regressions.","The dependent variable in a linear regression is the variable whose variability the regression model tries to explain. The independent variable is the variable whose variation the researcher uses to explain the variation of the dependent variable. If there is one independent variable in a linear regression and there are n observations of the dependent and independent variables, the regression model is Y i = b 0 + b 1 X i + e i , i = 1, . . . , n , where Y i is the dependent variable, X i is the independent variable, and e i is the error term. In this model, the coefficients and are the population intercept and slope, respectively. The intercept is the expected value of the dependent variable when the independent variable has a value of zero. The slope coefficient is the estimate of the population slope of the regression line and is the expected change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable. The assumptions of the classic simple linear regression model are as follows: Linearity: A linear relation exists between the dependent variable and the independent variable. Homoskedasticity: The variance of the error term is the same for all observations. Independence: The error term is uncorrelated across observations. Normality: The error term is normally distributed. The estimated parameters in a simple linear regression model minimize the sum of the squared errors. The coefficient of determination, or R 2 , measures the percentage of the total variation in the dependent variable explained by the independent variable. To test the fit of the simple linear regression, we can calculate an F -distributed test statistic and test the hypotheses H 0 : b 1 = 0 versus H a : b 1 ¹ 0, with 1 and n - 2 degrees of freedom. The standard error of the estimate is an absolute measure of the fit of the model calculated as the square root of the mean square error. We can evaluate a regression model by testing whether the population value of a regression coefficient is equal to a particular hypothesized value. We do this by calculating a t -distributed test statistic that compares the estimated parameter with the hypothesized parameter, dividing this difference by the standard error of the coefficient. An indicator (or dummy) variable takes on only the values 0 or 1 and can be used as the independent variable in a simple linear regression. In such a model, the interpretation of the intercept is the predicted value of the dependent variable if the indicator variable is 0, and when the indicator variable is 1, the slope is the difference in the means if we grouped the observations by the indicator variable. We calculate a prediction interval for a regression coefficient using the estimated coefficient, the standard error of the estimated coefficient, and the critical value for the t -distributed test statistic based on the level of significance and the appropriate degrees of freedom, which are n - 2 for simple regression. We can make predictions for the dependent variable using an estimated linear regression by inserting the forecasted value of the independent variable into the estimated model. The standard error of the forecast is the product of the standard error of the estimate and a term that reflects the sample size of the regression, the variation of the independent variable, and the deviation between the forecasted value of the independent variable and the mean of the independent variable in the regression. The prediction interval for a particular forecasted value of the dependent variable is formed by using the forecasted value of the dependent variable and extending above and below this value a quantity that reflects the critical t -value corresponding to the degrees of freedom, the level of significance, and the standard error of the forecast. If the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable is not linear, we can often transform one or both of these variables to convert this relation to a linear form, which then allows the use of simple linear regression.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V3R2-understanding-balance-sheets.pdf,Financial Reporting and Analysis,2023,Level I,"The balance sheet provides information on a company’s resources (assets) and its sources of capital (equity and liabilities/debt). This information helps an analyst assess a company’s ability to pay for its near-term operating needs, meet future debt obligations, and make distributions to owners. The basic equation underlying the balance sheet is Assets = Liabilities + Equity. Analysts should be aware that different types of assets and liabilities may be measured differently. For example, some items are measured at historical cost or a variation thereof and others at fair value. An understanding of the measurement issues will facilitate analysis. The balance sheet measurement issues are, of course, closely linked to the revenue and expense recognition issues affecting the income statement. Throughout this reading, we describe and illustrate some of the linkages between the measurement issues affecting the balance sheet and the revenue and expense recognition issues affecting the income statement. This reading is organized as follows: In Section 2, we describe and give examples of the elements and formats of balance sheets. Section 3 discusses current assets and current liabilities. Section 4 focuses on assets, and Section 5 focuses on liabilities. Section 6 describes the components of equity and illustrates the statement of changes in shareholders’ equity. Section 7 introduces balance sheet analysis. A summary of the key points and practice problems in the CFA Institute multiple-choice format conclude the reading.","The member should be able to: describe the elements of the balance sheet: assets, liabilities, and equity; describe uses and limitations of the balance sheet in financial analysis; describe alternative formats of balance sheet presentation; distinguish between current and non-current assets and current and non-current liabilities; describe different types of assets and liabilities and the measurement bases of each; describe the components of shareholders’ equity; convert balance sheets to common-size balance sheets and interpret common-size balance sheets; calculate and interpret liquidity and solvency ratios.","The balance sheet (also referred to as the statement of financial position) discloses what an entity owns (assets) and what it owes (liabilities) at a specific point in time. Equity is the owners’ residual interest in the assets of a company, net of its liabilities. The amount of equity is increased by income earned during the year, or by the issuance of new equity. The amount of equity is decreased by losses, by dividend payments, or by share repurchases. An understanding of the balance sheet enables an analyst to evaluate the liquidity, solvency, and overall financial position of a company. The balance sheet distinguishes between current and non-current assets and between current and non-current liabilities unless a presentation based on liquidity provides more relevant and reliable information. The concept of liquidity relates to a company’s ability to pay for its near-term operating needs. With respect to a company overall, liquidity refers to the availability of cash to pay those near-term needs. With respect to a particular asset or liability, liquidity refers to its “nearness to cash.” Some assets and liabilities are measured on the basis of fair value and some are measured at historical cost. Notes to financial statements provide information that is helpful in assessing the comparability of measurement bases across companies. Assets expected to be liquidated or used up within one year or one operating cycle of the business, whichever is greater, are classified as current assets. Assets not expected to be liquidated or used up within one year or one operating cycle of the business, whichever is greater, are classified as non-current assets. Liabilities expected to be settled or paid within one year or one operating cycle of the business, whichever is greater, are classified as current liabilities. Liabilities not expected to be settled or paid within one year or one operating cycle of the business, whichever is greater, are classified as non-current liabilities. Trade receivables, also referred to as accounts receivable, are amounts owed to a company by its customers for products and services already delivered. Receivables are reported net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Inventories are physical products that will eventually be sold to the company’s customers, either in their current form (finished goods) or as inputs into a process to manufacture a final product (raw materials and work-in-process). Inventories are reported at the lower of cost or net realizable value. If the net realizable value of a company’s inventory falls below its carrying amount, the company must write down the value of the inventory and record an expense. Inventory cost is based on specific identification or estimated using the first-in, first-out or weighted average cost methods. Some accounting standards (including US GAAP but not IFRS) also allow last-in, first-out as an additional inventory valuation method. Accounts payable, also called trade payables, are amounts that a business owes its vendors for purchases of goods and services. Deferred revenue (also known as unearned revenue) arises when a company receives payment in advance of delivery of the goods and services associated with the payment received. Property, plant, and equipment (PPE) are tangible assets that are used in company operations and expected to be used over more than one fiscal period. Examples of tangible assets include land, buildings, equipment, machinery, furniture, and natural resources such as mineral and petroleum resources. IFRS provide companies with the choice to report PPE using either a historical cost model or a revaluation model. US GAAP permit only the historical cost model for reporting PPE. Depreciation is the process of recognizing the cost of a long-lived asset over its useful life. (Land is not depreciated.) Under IFRS, property used to earn rental income or capital appreciation is considered to be an investment property. IFRS provide companies with the choice to report an investment property using either a historical cost model or a fair value model. Intangible assets refer to identifiable non-monetary assets without physical substance. Examples include patents, licenses, and trademarks. For each intangible asset, a company assesses whether the useful life is finite or indefinite. An intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortised on a systematic basis over the best estimate of its useful life, with the amortisation method and useful-life estimate reviewed at least annually. Impairment principles for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are the same as for PPE. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortised. Instead, it is tested for impairment at least annually. For internally generated intangible assets, IFRS require that costs incurred during the research phase must be expensed. Costs incurred in the development stage can be capitalized as intangible assets if certain criteria are met, including technological feasibility, the ability to use or sell the resulting asset, and the ability to complete the project. The most common intangible asset that is not a separately identifiable asset is goodwill, which arises in business combinations. Goodwill is not amortised; instead it is tested for impairment at least annually. Financial instruments are contracts that give rise to both a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. In general, there are two basic alternative ways that financial instruments are measured: fair value or amortised cost. For financial instruments measured at fair value, there are two basic alternatives in how net changes in fair value are recognized: as profit or loss on the income statement, or as other comprehensive income (loss) which bypasses the income statement. Typical long-term financial liabilities include loans (i.e., borrowings from banks) and notes or bonds payable (i.e., fixed-income securities issued to investors). Liabilities such as bonds issued by a company are usually reported at amortised cost on the balance sheet. Deferred tax liabilities arise from temporary timing differences between a company’s income as reported for tax purposes and income as reported for financial statement purposes. Six potential components that comprise the owners’ equity section of the balance sheet include: contributed capital, preferred shares, treasury shares, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, and non-controlling interest. The statement of changes in equity reflects information about the increases or decreases in each component of a company’s equity over a period. Vertical common-size analysis of the balance sheet involves stating each balance sheet item as a percentage of total assets. Balance sheet ratios include liquidity ratios (measuring the company’s ability to meet its short-term obligations) and solvency ratios (measuring the company’s ability to meet long-term and other obligations).

Fixed-income markets include not only publicly traded securities, such as commercial paper, notes, and bonds, but also non-publicly traded loans. Although they usually attract less attention than equity markets, fixed-income markets are more than three times the size of global equity markets. The Institute of International Finance reports that the size of the global debt market surpassed USD 253 trillion in the third quarter of 2019, representing a 322% global debt-to-GDP ratio (1 Institute of International Finance Global Debt Monitor, January 13, 2020). Debt investors and issuers need to understand how fixed-income markets are structured and how they operate. Debt issuers have financing needs that must be met. For example, a government may need to finance an infrastructure project, a new hospital, or a new school. A start-up technology company may require funds beyond its initial seed funding from investors to expand its business and achieve scale. Financial institutions also have funding needs, and they are among the largest issuers of fixed-income securities. Among the questions this reading addresses are the following: What are the key bond market sectors? How are bonds sold in primary markets and traded in secondary markets? What types of bonds are issued by governments, government-related entities, financial companies, and non-financial companies? What additional sources of funds are available to banks? We first present an overview of global fixed-income markets and how these markets are classified. We identify the major issuers of and investors in fixed-income securities, present fixed-income indexes, discuss how fixed-income securities are issued in primary markets, and explore how these securities are then traded in secondary markets. We also examine different bond market sectors and discuss additional short-term funding alternatives available to banks.","The member should be able to: describe classifications of global fixed-income markets; describe the use of interbank offered rates as reference rates in floating-rate debt; describe mechanisms available for issuing bonds in primary markets; describe secondary markets for bonds; describe securities issued by sovereign governments; describe securities issued by non-sovereign governments, quasi-government entities, and supranational agencies; describe types of debt issued by corporations; describe structured financial instruments; describe short-term funding alternatives available to banks; describe repurchase agreements (repos) and the risks associated with them.","Debt financing is an important source of funds for households, governments, government-related entities, financial institutions, and non-financial companies. Well-functioning fixed-income markets help ensure that capital is allocated efficiently to its highest and best use globally. Important points include the following: The most widely used ways of classifying fixed-income markets include the type of issuer; the bonds’ credit quality, maturity, currency denomination, and type of coupon; and where the bonds are issued and traded. Based on the type of issuer, the four major bond market sectors are the household, non-financial corporate, government, and financial institution sectors. Investors distinguish between investment-grade and high-yield bond markets based on the issuer’s credit quality. Money markets are where securities with original maturities ranging from overnight to one year are issued and traded, whereas capital markets are where securities with original maturities longer than one year are issued and traded. The majority of bonds are denominated in either euros or US dollars. Investors distinguish between bonds that pay a fixed rate versus a floating rate of interest. The coupon rate of floating-rate bonds is often expressed as a reference rate plus a spread. Interbank offered rates, such as Libor, historically have been the most commonly used reference rates for floating-rate debt and other financial instruments but are being phased out to be replaced by alternative reference rates. Based on where the bonds are issued and traded, investors distinguish between domestic and international bond markets. The latter includes the Eurobond market, which falls outside the jurisdiction of any single country and is characterized by less reporting, regulatory, and tax constraints. Investors also distinguish between developed and emerging bond markets. Investors and investment managers use fixed-income indexes to describe bond markets or sectors and to evaluate performance of investments and investment managers. The largest investors in bonds include central banks; institutional investors, such as pension funds, hedge funds, charitable foundations and endowments, insurance companies, mutual funds and ETFs, and banks; and retail investors, typically by means of indirect investments. Primary markets are markets in which issuers first sell bonds to investors to raise capital. Secondary markets are markets in which existing bonds are subsequently traded among investors. There are two mechanisms for issuing a bond in primary markets: a public offering, in which any member of the public may buy the bonds, or a private placement, in which only an investor or small group of investors may buy the bonds either directly from the issuer or through an investment bank. Public bond issuing mechanisms include underwritten offerings, best-efforts offerings, shelf registrations, and auctions. When an investment bank underwrites a bond issue, it buys the entire issue and takes the risk of reselling it to investors or dealers. In contrast, in a best-efforts offering, the investment bank serves only as a broker and sells the bond issue only if it is able to do so. Underwritten and best-efforts offerings are frequently used in the issuance of corporate bonds. The underwriting process typically includes six phases: the determination of the funding needs, the selection of the underwriter, the structuring and announcement of the bond offering, pricing, issuance, and closing. A shelf registration is a method for issuing securities in which the issuer files a single document with regulators that describes and allows for a range of future issuances. An auction is a public offering method that involves bidding and is helpful both in providing price discovery and in allocating securities. Auctions are frequently used in the issuance of sovereign bonds. Most bonds are traded in OTC markets, and institutional investors are the major buyers and sellers of bonds in secondary markets. Sovereign bonds are issued by national governments primarily for fiscal reasons. These bonds take different names and forms depending on where they are issued, their maturities, and their coupon types. Most sovereign bonds are fixed-rate bonds, although some national governments also issue floating-rate bonds and inflation-linked bonds. Local governments, quasi-government entities, and supranational agencies issue bonds, which are named non-sovereign, quasi-government, and supranational bonds, respectively. Companies raise debt in the form of bilateral loans, syndicated loans, commercial paper, notes, and bonds. Commercial paper is a short-term unsecured security that companies use as a source of short-term and bridge financing. Investors in commercial paper are exposed to credit risk, although defaults are rare. Many issuers roll over their commercial paper on a regular basis. Corporate bonds and notes take different forms depending on the maturities, coupon payment, and principal repayment structures. Important considerations also include collateral backing and contingency provisions. Medium-term notes are securities that are offered continuously to investors by an agent of the issuer. They can have short-term or long-term maturities. The structured finance sector includes asset-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations, and other structured financial instruments. All of these seemingly disparate financial instruments share the common attribute of repackaging risks. Many structured financial instruments are customized instruments that often combine a bond and at least one derivative. The redemption and often the coupons of these structured financial instruments are linked via a formula to the performance of the underlying asset(s). Thus, the bond’s payment features are replaced with non-traditional payoffs derived not from the issuer’s cash flows but from the performance of the underlying asset(s). Capital protected, yield enhancement, participation and leveraged instruments are typical examples of structured financial instruments. Financial institutions have access to additional sources of funds, such as retail deposits, central bank funds, interbank funds, large-denomination negotiable certificates of deposit, and repurchase agreements. A repurchase agreement is similar to a collateralized loan. It involves the sale of a security (the collateral) with a simultaneous agreement by the seller (the borrower) to buy back the same security from the purchaser (the lender) at an agreed-on price in the future. Repurchase agreements are a common source of funding for dealer firms and are also used to borrow securities to implement short positions.

These instruments allow governments, companies, and other issuers to borrow from investors, promising future interest payments and the return of principal, which are contractual (legal) obligations of the issuer. Fixed-income securities are the largest source of capital for government, not-for-profit, and other entities that do not issue equity. For private companies, fixed-income investors differ from shareholders in not having ownership rights. Payments of interest and repayment of principal (amount borrowed) are a higher priority claim on the company’s earnings and assets compared with the claim of common shareholders. Since fixed-income claims rank above shareholder claims in the capital structure, a company’s fixed-income securities have, in theory, lower risk than their common shares. Financial analysts who master these and other fixed-income concepts have a distinct edge over their peers for several reasons. First, given the nature of fixed-income cash flows and their preponderance across issuers and regions, these instruments form the basis for risk versus return comparisons both across and within specific jurisdictions. For example, as bonds issued by the US Treasury and other developed market central governments are viewed as having little to no default risk, they serve as building blocks in determining the time value of money for less certain cash flows. Fixed-income securities also fulfill an important role in portfolio management as a prime means by which individual and institutional investors can fund known future obligations, such as tuition payments or retirement obligations. Finally, while the correlation of fixed-income returns with common share returns varies, adding fixed-income securities to portfolios that include common shares can be an effective way of obtaining diversification benefits. Among the questions to be addressed are the following: Which features define a fixed-income security, and how do they determine the scheduled cash flows? What are the legal, regulatory, and tax considerations associated with a fixed-income security, and why are they important for investors? What are the common interest and principal payment structures? What types of provisions may affect the disposal or redemption of fixed-income securities? Note that the terms “fixed-income securities,” “debt securities,” and “bonds” are often used interchangeably by experts and non-experts alike. We will also follow this convention, and where any nuance of meaning is intended, it will be made clear. Moreover, the term “fixed income” is not to be understood literally: Some fixed-income securities have interest payments that change over time.","The member should be able to: describe basic features of a fixed-income security; compare affirmative and negative covenants and identify examples of each; describe how legal, regulatory, and tax considerations affect the issuance and trading of fixed-income securities; describe how cash flows of fixed-income securities are structured; describe contingency provisions affecting the timing and/or nature of cash flows of fixed-income securities and whether such provisions benefit the borrower or the lender.","This reading introduces the salient features of fixed-income securities while noting how these features vary among different types of securities. Important points include the following: The three important elements that an investor needs to know when investing in a fixed-income security are: (1) the bond’s features, which determine its scheduled cash flows and thus the bondholder’s expected and actual return; (2) the legal, regulatory, and tax considerations that apply to the contractual agreement between the issuer and the bondholders; and (3) the contingency provisions that may affect the bond’s scheduled cash flows. The basic features of a bond include the issuer, maturity, par value (or principal), coupon rate and frequency, and currency denomination. Issuers of bonds include supranational organizations, sovereign governments, non-sovereign governments, quasi-government entities, and corporate issuers. Bondholders are exposed to credit risk and may use bond credit ratings to assess the credit quality of a bond. A bond’s principal is the amount the issuer agrees to pay the bondholder when the bond matures. The coupon rate is the interest rate that the issuer agrees to pay to the bondholder each year. The coupon rate can be a fixed rate or a floating rate. Bonds may offer annual, semi-annual, quarterly, or monthly coupon payments depending on the type of bond and where the bond is issued. Bonds can be issued in any currency. Such bonds as dual-currency bonds and currency option bonds are connected to two currencies. The yield-to-maturity is the discount rate that equates the present value of the bond’s future cash flows until maturity to its price. Yield-to-maturity can be considered an estimate of the market’s expectation for the bond’s return. A plain vanilla bond has a known cash flow pattern. It has a fixed maturity date and pays a fixed rate of interest over the bond’s life. The bond indenture or trust deed is the legal contract that describes the form of the bond, the issuer’s obligations, and the investor’s rights. The indenture is usually held by a financial institution called a trustee, which performs various duties specified in the indenture. The issuer is identified in the indenture by its legal name and is obligated to make timely payments of interest and repayment of principal. For asset-backed securities, the legal obligation to repay bondholders often lies with a separate legal entity—that is, a bankruptcy-remote vehicle that uses the assets as guarantees to back a bond issue. How the issuer intends to service the debt and repay the principal should be described in the indenture. The source of repayment proceeds varies depending on the type of bond. Collateral backing is a way to alleviate credit risk. Secured bonds are backed by assets or financial guarantees pledged to ensure debt payment. Examples of collateral-backed bonds include collateral trust bonds, equipment trust certificates, mortgage-backed securities, and covered bonds. Credit enhancement can be internal or external. Examples of internal credit enhancement include subordination, overcollateralization, and reserve accounts. A bank guarantee, a surety bond, a letter of credit, and a cash collateral account are examples of external credit enhancement. Bond covenants are legally enforceable rules that borrowers and lenders agree on at the time of a new bond issue. Affirmative covenants enumerate what issuers are required to do, whereas negative covenants enumerate what issuers are prohibited from doing. An important consideration for investors is where the bonds are issued and traded, because it affects the laws, regulation, and tax status that apply. Bonds issued in a country in local currency are domestic bonds if they are issued by entities incorporated in the country and foreign bonds if they are issued by entities incorporated in another country. Eurobonds are issued internationally, outside the jurisdiction of any single country and are subject to a lower level of listing, disclosure, and regulatory requirements than domestic or foreign bonds. Global bonds are issued in the Eurobond market and at least one domestic market at the same time. Although some bonds may offer special tax advantages, as a general rule, interest is taxed at the ordinary income tax rate. Some countries also implement a capital gains tax. There may be specific tax provisions for bonds issued at a discount or bought at a premium An amortizing bond is a bond whose payment schedule requires periodic payment of interest and repayment of principal. This differs from a bullet bond, whose entire payment of principal occurs at maturity. The amortizing bond’s outstanding principal amount is reduced to zero by the maturity date for a fully amortized bond, but a balloon payment is required at maturity to retire the bond’s outstanding principal amount for a partially amortized bond. Sinking fund agreements provide another approach to the periodic retirement of principal, in which an amount of the bond’s principal outstanding amount is usually repaid each year throughout the bond’s life or after a specified date. A floating-rate note, or floater, is a bond whose coupon is set based on a market reference rate (MRR) plus a spread. FRNs can be floored, capped, or collared. An inverse FRN is a bond whose coupon has an inverse relationship to the reference rate. Other coupon payment structures include bonds with step-up coupons, which pay coupons that increase by specified amounts on specified dates; bonds with credit-linked coupons, which change when the issuer’s credit rating changes; bonds with payment-in-kind coupons, which allow the issuer to pay coupons with additional amounts of the bond issue rather than in cash; and bonds with deferred coupons, which pay no coupons in the early years following the issue but higher coupons thereafter. The payment structures for index-linked bonds vary considerably among countries. A common index-linked bond is an inflation-linked bond, or linker, whose coupon payments and/or principal repayments are linked to a price index. Index-linked payment structures include zero-coupon-indexed bonds, interest-indexed bonds, capital-indexed bonds, and indexed-annuity bonds. Common types of bonds with embedded options include callable bonds, putable bonds, and convertible bonds. These options are “embedded” in the sense that there are provisions provided in the indenture that grant either the issuer or the bondholder certain rights affecting the disposal or redemption of the bond. They are not separately traded securities. Callable bonds give the issuer the right to buy bonds back prior to maturity, thereby raising the reinvestment risk for the bondholder. For this reason, callable bonds have to offer a higher yield and sell at a lower price than otherwise similar non-callable bonds to compensate the bondholders for the value of the call option to the issuer. Putable bonds give the bondholder the right to sell bonds back to the issuer prior to maturity. Putable bonds offer a lower yield and sell at a higher price than otherwise similar non-putable bonds to compensate the issuer for the value of the put option to the bondholders. A convertible bond gives the bondholder the right to convert the bond into common shares of the issuing company. Because this option favors the bondholder, convertible bonds offer a lower yield and sell at a higher price than otherwise similar non-convertible bonds.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V3R8-noncurrent-long-term-liabilities.pdf,Financial Reporting and Analysis,2023,Level I,"A non-current liability (long-term liability) broadly represents a probable sacrifice of economic benefits in periods generally greater than one year in the future. Common types of non-current liabilities reported in a company’s financial statements include long-term debt (e.g., bonds payable, long-term notes payable), leases, pension liabilities, and deferred tax liabilities. This reading focuses on bonds payable, leases, and pension liabilities. This reading is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces bonds and the accounting for their issuance. Section 3 discusses the recording of interest expense and interest payments as well as the amortisation of discount or premium. Section 4 describes fair value accounting for bonds, an alternative to the amortised cost approach. Section 5 discusses the repayment of principal when bonds are redeemed or reach maturity, which requires derecognition from the financial statements. Section 6 covers debt covenants. Section 7 describes the financial statement presentation and disclosures about debt financings. Section 8 discusses leases, including the benefits of leasing and accounting for leases by both lessees and lessors. Section 9 introduces pension accounting and the resulting non-current liabilities. Section 10 discusses the use of leverage and coverage ratios in evaluating solvency. Section 11 concludes and summarises the reading.","The member should be able to: determine the initial recognition, initial measurement and subsequent measurement of bonds; describe the effective interest method and calculate interest expense, amortisation of bond discounts/premiums, and interest payments; explain the derecognition of debt; describe the role of debt covenants in protecting creditors; describe the financial statement presentation of and disclosures relating to debt; explain motivations for leasing assets instead of purchasing them; explain the financial reporting of leases from a lessee’s perspective; explain the financial reporting of leases from a lessor’s perspective; compare the presentation and disclosure of defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans; calculate and interpret leverage and coverage ratios.","Non-current liabilities arise from different sources of financing and different types of creditors. Bonds are a common source of financing from debt markets. Key points in accounting and reporting of non-current liabilities include the following: The sales proceeds of a bond issue are determined by discounting future cash payments using the market rate of interest at the time of issuance (effective interest rate). The reported interest expense on bonds is based on the effective interest rate. Future cash payments on bonds usually include periodic interest payments (made at the stated interest rate or coupon rate) and the principal amount at maturity. When the market rate of interest equals the coupon rate for the bonds, the bonds will sell at par (i.e., at a price equal to the face value). When the market rate of interest is higher than the bonds’ coupon rate, the bonds will sell at a discount. When the market rate of interest is lower than the bonds’ coupon rate, the bonds will sell at a premium. An issuer amortises any issuance discount or premium on bonds over the life of the bonds. If a company redeems bonds before maturity, it reports a gain or loss on debt extinguishment computed as the net carrying amount of the bonds (including bond issuance costs under IFRS) less the amount required to redeem the bonds. Debt covenants impose restrictions on borrowers, such as limitations on future borrowing or requirements to maintain a minimum debt-to-equity ratio. The carrying amount of bonds is typically the amortised historical cost, which can differ from their fair value. Companies are required to disclose the fair value of financial liabilities, including debt. Although permitted to do so, few companies opt to report debt at fair values on the balance sheet. A lease is a contract in which a lessor grants the lessee the exclusive right to use a specific underlying asset for a period of time in exchange for payments. Leasing is a common arrangement because it has several advantages over purchasing an asset outright: less upfront cash commitment, generally low interest rates, and lower risks associated with ownership such as obsolescence. Leases are classified as operating or finance leases. Finance leases resemble an asset purchase or sale while operating leases resemble a rental agreement. US GAAP and IFRS share the same accounting treatment for lessors but differ for lessees. IFRS has a single accounting model for both operating leases and finance lease lessees, while US GAAP has an accounting model for each. Lessees reporting under IFRS and finance lease lessees reporting under US GAAP recognize a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset on the balance sheet, equal to the present value of lease payments. The liability is subsequently reduced using the effective interest method and the right-of-use asset is amortized. Interest expense and amortization expense are shown separately on the income statement. The statement of cash flows shows the entire lease payment. Operating lease lessees reporting under US GAAP recognize a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset on the balance sheet, equal to the present value of lease payments. The liability is subsequently reduced using the effective interest method, but the amortization of the right-of-use asset is the lease payment less the interest expense. Interest expense and amortization expense are shown together as a single operating expense on the income statement. Finance lease lessors (IFRS and US GAAP) recognize a lease receivable asset equal to the present value of future lease payments and de-recognize the leased asset, simultaneously recognizing any difference as a gain or loss. The lease receivable is subsequently reduced by each lease payment using the effective interest method. Interest income is reported on the income statement, typically as revenue, and the entire cash receipt is reported under operating activities on the statement of cash flows. Operating lease lessors (IFRS and US GAAP): The balance sheet is not affected—The lessor continues to recognize the underlying asset and depreciate it. Lease revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis on the income statement and the entire cash receipt is reported under operating activities on the statement of cash flows. Two types of pension plans are defined contribution plans and defined benefits plans. In a defined contribution plan, the amount of contribution into the plan is specified (i.e., defined) and the amount of pension that is ultimately paid by the plan (received by the retiree) depends on the performance of the plan’s assets. In a defined benefit plan, the amount of pension that is ultimately paid by the plan (received by the retiree) is defined, usually according to a benefit formula. Under a defined contribution pension plan, the cash payment made into the plan is recognised as pension expense. Under both IFRS and US GAAP, companies must report the difference between the defined benefit pension obligation and the pension assets as an asset or liability on the balance sheet. An underfunded defined benefit pension plan is shown as a non-current liability. Under IFRS, the change in the defined benefit plan net asset or liability is recognised as a cost of the period, with two components of the change (service cost and net interest expense or income) recognised in profit and loss and one component (remeasurements) of the change recognised in other comprehensive income. Under US GAAP, the change in the defined benefit plan net asset or liability is also recognised as a cost of the period with three components of the change (current service costs, interest expense on the beginning pension obligation, and expected return on plan assets) recognised in profit and loss and two components (past service costs and actuarial gains and losses) typically recognised in other comprehensive income. Solvency refers to a company’s ability to meet its long-term debt obligations. In evaluating solvency, leverage ratios focus on the balance sheet and measure the amount of debt financing relative to equity financing. In evaluating solvency, coverage ratios focus on the income statement and cash flows and measure the ability of a company to cover its interest payments.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V1R5-sampling-estimation.pdf,Quantitative Methods,2023,Level I,"Each day, we observe the high, low, and close of stock market indexes from around the world. Indexes such as the S&P 500 Index and the Nikkei 225 Stock Average are samples of stocks. Although the S&P 500 and the Nikkei do not represent the populations of US or Japanese stocks, we view them as valid indicators of the whole population’s behavior. As analysts, we are accustomed to using this sample information to assess how various markets from around the world are performing. Any statistics that we compute with sample information, however, are only estimates of the underlying population parameters. A sample, then, is a subset of the population—a subset studied to infer conclusions about the population itself. We introduce and discuss sampling —the process of obtaining a sample. In investments, we continually make use of the mean as a measure of central tendency of random variables, such as return and earnings per share. Even when the probability distribution of the random variable is unknown, we can make probability statements about the population mean using the central limit theorem. We discuss and illustrate this key result. Following that discussion, we turn to statistical estimation. Estimation seeks precise answers to the question “What is this parameter’s value?” The central limit theorem and estimation, the core of the body of methods presented in the sections that follow, may be applied in investment applications. We often interpret the results for the purpose of deciding what works and what does not work in investments. We will also discuss the interpretation of statistical results based on financial data and the possible pitfalls in this process.","The member should be able to: compare and contrast probability samples with non-probability samples and discuss applications of each to an investment problem; explain sampling error; compare and contrast simple random, stratified random, cluster, convenience, and judgmental sampling; explain the central limit theorem and its importance; calculate and interpret the standard error of the sample mean; identify and describe desirable properties of an estimator; contrast a point estimate and a confidence interval estimate of a population parameter; calculate and interpret a confidence interval for a population mean, given a normal distribution with 1) a known population variance, 2) an unknown population variance, or 3) an unknown population variance and a large sample size; describe the use of resampling (bootstrap, jackknife) to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic. describe the issues regarding selection of the appropriate sample size, data snooping bias, sample selection bias, survivorship bias, look-ahead bias, and time-period bias.","In this reading, we have presented basic concepts and results in sampling and estimation. We have also emphasized the challenges faced by analysts in appropriately using and interpreting financial data. As analysts, we should always use a critical eye when evaluating the results from any study. The quality of the sample is of the utmost importance: If the sample is biased, the conclusions drawn from the sample will be in error. To draw valid inferences from a sample, the sample should be random. In simple random sampling, each observation has an equal chance of being selected. In stratified random sampling, the population is divided into subpopulations, called strata or cells, based on one or more classification criteria; simple random samples are then drawn from each stratum. Stratified random sampling ensures that population subdivisions of interest are represented in the sample. Stratified random sampling also produces more-precise parameter estimates than simple random sampling. Convenience sampling selects an element from the population on the basis of whether or not it is accessible to a researcher or how easy it is to access. Because convenience sampling presents the advantage of collecting data quickly at a low cost, it is a suitable sampling plan for small-scale pilot studies. Judgmental sampling may yield skewed results because of the bias of researchers, but its advantages lie in the fact that in some circumstances, the specialty of researchers and their judgmental can lead them directly to the target population of interest within time constraints. The central limit theorem states that for large sample sizes, for any underlying distribution for a random variable, the sampling distribution of the sample mean for that variable will be approximately normal, with mean equal to the population mean for that random variable and variance equal to the population variance of the variable divided by sample size. Based on the central limit theorem, when the sample size is large, we can compute confidence intervals for the population mean based on the normal distribution regardless of the distribution of the underlying population. In general, a sample size of 30 or larger can be considered large. An estimator is a formula for estimating a parameter. An estimate is a particular value that we calculate from a sample by using an estimator. Because an estimator or statistic is a random variable, it is described by some probability distribution. We refer to the distribution of an estimator as its sampling distribution. The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean is called the standard error of the sample mean. The desirable properties of an estimator are unbiasedness (the expected value of the estimator equals the population parameter), efficiency (the estimator has the smallest variance), and consistency (the probability of accurate estimates increases as sample size increases). The two types of estimates of a parameter are point estimates and interval estimates. A point estimate is a single number that we use to estimate a parameter. An interval estimate is a range of values that brackets the population parameter with some probability. A confidence interval is an interval for which we can assert with a given probability 1 − a , called the degree of confidence, that it will contain the parameter it is intended to estimate. This measure is often referred to as the 100(1 − a )% confidence interval for the parameter. A 100(1 − a )% confidence interval for a parameter has the following structure: Point estimate ± Reliability factor × Standard error, where the reliability factor is a number based on the assumed distribution of the point estimate and the degree of confidence (1 − a ) for the confidence interval and where standard error is the standard error of the sample statistic providing the point estimate. A 100(1 − a )% confidence interval for population mean µ when sampling from a normal distribution with known variance s 2 is given by , where z a /2 is the point of the standard normal distribution such that a /2 remains in the right tail. A random sample of size n is said to have n − 1 degrees of freedom for estimating the population variance, in the sense that there are only n − 1 independent deviations from the mean on which to base the estimate. A 100(1 − a )% confidence interval for the population mean µ when sampling from a normal distribution with unknown variance (a t -distribution confidence interval) is given by , where t a /2 is the point of the t -distribution such that a /2 remains in the right tail and s is the sample standard deviation. This confidence interval can also be used, because of the central limit theorem, when dealing with a large sample from a population with unknown variance that may not be normal. We may use the confidence interval as an alternative to the t -distribution confidence interval for the population mean when using a large sample from a population with unknown variance. The confidence interval based on the z- statistic is less conservative (narrower) than the corresponding confidence interval based on a t -distribution. Bootstrap and jackknife are simple but powerful methods for statistical inference, and they are particularly useful when no analytical formula is available. Bootstrap constructs the sampling distribution of an estimator by repeatedly drawing samples from the original sample to find standard error and confidence interval. Jackknife draws repeated samples while leaving out one observation at a time from the set, without replacing it. Three issues in the selection of sample size are the need for precision, the risk of sampling from more than one population, and the expenses of different sample sizes. • Data snooping bias comes from finding models by repeatedly searching through databases for patterns. • Sample selection bias occurs when data availability leads to certain assets being excluded from the analysis, we call the resulting problem • Survivorship bias is a subset of sample selection bias and occurs if companies are excluded from the analysis because they have gone out of business or because of reasons related to poor performance. • Self-selection bias reflects the ability of entities to decide whether or not they wish to report their attributes or results and be included in databases or samples. Implicit selection bias is one type of selection bias introduced through the presence of a threshold that filters out some unqualified members. A subset of selection bias is backfill bias , in which past data, not reported or used before, is backfilled into an existing database. • Look-ahead bias exists if the model uses data not available to market participants at the time the market participants act in the model. • Time-period bias is present if the period used makes the results period specific or if the period used includes a point of structural change.

The tools that allow us to make decisions with consistency and logic in this setting are based on probability concepts. This reading presents the essential probability tools needed to frame and address many real-world problems involving risk. These tools apply to a variety of issues, such as predicting investment manager performance, forecasting financial variables, and pricing bonds so that they fairly compensate bondholders for default risk. Our focus is practical. We explore the concepts that are most important to investment research and practice. Among these are independence, as it relates to the predictability of returns and financial variables; expectation, as analysts continually look to the future in their analyses and decisions; and variability, variance or dispersion around expectation, as a risk concept important in investments. The reader will acquire specific skills and competencies in using these probability concepts to understand risks and returns on investments.","The member should be able to: define a random variable, an outcome, and an event; identify the two defining properties of probability, including mutually exclusive and exhaustive events, and compare and contrast empirical, subjective, and a priori probabilities; describe the probability of an event in terms of odds for and against the event; calculate and interpret conditional probabilities; demonstrate the application of the multiplication and addition rules for probability; compare and contrast dependent and independent events; calculate and interpret an unconditional probability using the total probability rule; calculate and interpret the expected value, variance, and standard deviation of random variables; explain the use of conditional expectation in investment applications; interpret a probability tree and demonstrate its application to investment problems; calculate and interpret the expected value, variance, standard deviation, covariances, and correlations of portfolio returns; calculate and interpret the covariances of portfolio returns using the joint probability function; calculate and interpret an updated probability using Bayes’ formula; identify the most appropriate method to solve a particular counting problem and analyze counting problems using factorial, combination, and permutation concepts.","In this reading, we have discussed the essential concepts and tools of probability. We have applied probability, expected value, and variance to a range of investment problems. A random variable is a quantity whose outcome is uncertain. Probability is a number between 0 and 1 that describes the chance that a stated event will occur. An event is a specified set of outcomes of a random variable. Mutually exclusive events can occur only one at a time. Exhaustive events cover or contain all possible outcomes. The two defining properties of a probability are, first, that 0 ≤ P ( E ) ≤ 1 (where P ( E ) denotes the probability of an event E ), and second, that the sum of the probabilities of any set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events equals 1. A probability estimated from data as a relative frequency of occurrence is an empirical probability. A probability drawing on personal or subjective judgment is a subjective probability. A probability obtained based on logical analysis is an a priori probability. A probability of an event E , P ( E ), can be stated as odds for E = P ( E )/[1 − P ( E )] or odds against E = [1 − P ( E )]/ P ( E ). Probabilities that are inconsistent create profit opportunities, according to the Dutch Book Theorem. A probability of an event not conditioned on another event is an unconditional probability. The unconditional probability of an event A is denoted P ( A ). Unconditional probabilities are also called marginal probabilities. A probability of an event given (conditioned on) another event is a conditional probability. The probability of an event A given an event B is denoted P ( A | B ), and P ( A | B ) = P ( AB )/ P ( B ), P ( B ) ≠ 0. The probability of both A and B occurring is the joint probability of A and B , denoted P ( AB ). The multiplication rule for probabilities is P ( AB ) = P ( A | B ) P ( B ). The probability that A or B occurs, or both occur, is denoted by P ( A or B ). The addition rule for probabilities is P ( A or B ) = P ( A ) + P ( B ) − P ( AB ). When events are independent, the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of occurrence of the other event. Otherwise, the events are dependent. The multiplication rule for independent events states that if A and B are independent events, P ( AB ) = P ( A ) P ( B ). The rule generalizes in similar fashion to more than two events. According to the total probability rule, if S 1 , S 2 , …, S n are mutually exclusive and exhaustive scenarios or events, then P ( A ) = P ( A | S 1 ) P ( S 1 ) + P ( A | S 2 ) P ( S 2 ) + … + P ( A | S n ) P ( S n ). The expected value of a random variable is a probability-weighted average of the possible outcomes of the random variable. For a random variable X , the expected value of X is denoted E ( X ). The total probability rule for expected value states that E ( X ) = E ( X | S 1 ) P ( S 1 ) + E ( X | S 2 ) P ( S 2 ) + … + E ( X | S n ) P ( S n ), where S 1 , S 2 , …, S n are mutually exclusive and exhaustive scenarios or events. The variance of a random variable is the expected value (the probability-weighted average) of squared deviations from the random variable’s expected value E ( X ): σ 2 ( X ) = E {[ X − E ( X )] 2 }, where σ 2 ( X ) stands for the variance of X . Variance is a measure of dispersion about the mean. Increasing variance indicates increasing dispersion. Variance is measured in squared units of the original variable. Standard deviation is the positive square root of variance. Standard deviation measures dispersion (as does variance), but it is measured in the same units as the variable. Covariance is a measure of the co-movement between random variables. The covariance between two random variables R i and R j in a forward-looking sense is the expected value of the cross-product of the deviations of the two random variables from their respective means: Cov( R i , R j ) = E {[ R i − E ( R i )][ R j − E ( R j )]}. The covariance of a random variable with itself is its own variance. The historical or sample covariance between two random variables R i and R j based on a sample of past data of size n is the average value of the product of the deviations of observations on two random variables from their sample means: Cov ( R i , R j ) = ∑ i = 1 n ( R i , t − R ¯ i ) ( R j , t − R ¯ j ) / ( n − 1 ) Correlation is a number between −1 and +1 that measures the co-movement (linear association) between two random variables: ρ( R i , R j ) = Cov( R i , R j )/[σ( R i ) σ( R j )]. If two variables have a very strong linear relation, then the absolute value of their correlation will be close to 1. If two variables have a weak linear relation, then the absolute value of their correlation will be close to 0. If the correlation coefficient is positive, the two variables are directly related; if the correlation coefficient is negative, the two variables are inversely related. To calculate the variance of return on a portfolio of n assets, the inputs needed are the n expected returns on the individual assets, n variances of return on the individual assets, and n ( n − 1)/2 distinct covariances. Portfolio variance of return is σ 2 ( R p ) = ∑ i = 1 n ∑ j = 1 n w i w j Cov ( R i , R j ) . The calculation of covariance in a forward-looking sense requires the specification of a joint probability function, which gives the probability of joint occurrences of values of the two random variables. When two random variables are independent, the joint probability function is the product of the individual probability functions of the random variables. Bayes’ formula is a method for updating probabilities based on new information. Bayes’ formula is expressed as follows: Updated probability of event given the new information = [(Probability of the new information given event)/(Unconditional probability of the new information)] × Prior probability of event. The multiplication rule of counting says, for example, that if the first step in a process can be done in 10 ways, the second step, given the first, can be done in 5 ways, and the third step, given the first two, can be done in 7 ways, then the steps can be carried out in (10)(5)(7) = 350 ways. The number of ways to assign every member of a group of size n to n slots is n ! = n ( n − 1) ( n − 2)( n − 3) … 1. (By convention, 0! = 1.) The number of ways that n objects can be labeled with k different labels, with n 1 of the first type, n 2 of the second type, and so on, with n 1 + n 2 + … + n k = n , is given by n !/( n 1 ! n 2 ! … n k !). This expression is the multinomial formula. A special case of the multinomial formula is the combination formula. The number of ways to choose r objects from a total of n objects, when the order in which the r objects are listed does not matter, is n C r = ( n r ) = n ! ( n − r ) ! r ! The number of ways to choose r objects from a total of n objects, when the order in which the r objects are listed does matter, is n P r = n ! ( n − r ) ! This expression is the permutation formula.

The private wealth sector has grown considerably as global wealth has increased and as individuals have taken on more of the responsibility for managing their own financial resources. Private wealth managers can help individual investors seek the benefits as well as navigate the complexities of financial markets. This reading introduces candidates to the process of designing and executing an investment plan or strategy for the individual investor. We discuss the tools and techniques used by private wealth managers and how the wealth manager interacts with the client to serve the client’s needs. Section 2 examines the key differences between private clients and institutional clients. In Section 3, we discuss how the wealth manager gains an understanding of the client and identifies key attributes of the client’s financial situation that are relevant to the wealth management process. Section 4 covers investment planning, including capital sufficiency and retirement planning. Section 5 discusses the investment policy statement, including its various underlying parts. Section 6 analyzes portfolio construction, portfolio reporting, and portfolio review. Finally, in Section 7, we discuss the practice of private wealth management, including ethical considerations for private wealth managers, compliance considerations, and the various client segments that private wealth managers encounter. Reflecting the variation in industry terms, we use the terms “private wealth managers,” “wealth managers,” and “advisors” interchangeably. We also refer to “individual investors” as “private clients” or, simply, “clients.” In practice, private wealth managers typically operate either independently or as representatives of organizations, such as wealth management firms, banks, and broker/dealers.",The member should be able to: contrast private client and institutional client investment concerns; discuss information needed in advising private clients; identify tax considerations affecting a private client’s investments; identify and formulate client goals based on client information; evaluate a private client’s risk tolerance; describe technical and soft skills needed in advising private clients; evaluate capital sufficiency in relation to client goals; discuss the principles of retirement planning; discuss the parts of an investment policy statement (IPS) for a private client; prepare the investment objectives section of an IPS for a private client; evaluate and recommend improvements to an IPS for a private client; recommend and justify portfolio allocations and investments for a private client; describe effective practices in portfolio reporting and review; evaluate the success of an investment program for a private client; discuss ethical and compliance considerations in advising private clients; discuss how levels of service and range of solutions are related to different private clients.,"Private clients and institutional clients have different concerns, primarily relating to investment objectives and constraints, investment governance, investment sophistication, regulation, and the uniqueness of individuals. Information needed in advising private clients includes personal information, financial information, and tax considerations. Basic tax strategies for private clients include tax avoidance, tax reduction, and tax deferral. A client’s planned goals are those that can be reasonably estimated or quantified within an expected time horizon, such as retirement, specific purchases, education, family events, wealth transfer, and philanthropy. Unplanned goals are those related to unforeseen financial needs, such as property repairs and medical expenses. When establishing client goals, private wealth managers consider goal quantification, goal prioritization, and goal changes. Risk tolerance refers to the level of risk an individual is willing and able to bear. Risk tolerance is the inverse of risk aversion. Risk capacity is the ability to accept financial risk. Risk perception is an individual’s subjective assessment of the risk involved in an investment decision’s outcome. Wealth managers often utilize questionnaires to assess clients’ risk tolerance. The result of a risk tolerance questionnaire, typically a numerical score, is often used as an input in the investment planning process. Wealth managers need both technical skills and non-technical (“soft”) skills in their advisory roles. Technical skills include capital markets proficiency, portfolio construction ability, financial planning knowledge, quantitative skills, technology skills, and in some situations, foreign language fluency. Soft skills include communication skills, social skills, education/coaching skills, and business development and sales skills. Capital sufficiency analysis, also known as capital needs analysis, is the process by which a wealth manager determines whether a client has, or is likely to accumulate, sufficient financial resources to meet his or her objectives. Two methods for evaluating capital sufficiency are deterministic forecasting and Monte Carlo simulation. Wealth managers use several different methods to analyze a client’s retirement goals, including mortality tables, annuities, and Monte Carlo simulation. An investment policy statement (IPS) for an individual includes the following parts: background and investment objective(s); investment parameters (risk tolerance and investment time horizon); asset class preferences; other investment preferences (liquidity and constraints); portfolio asset allocation; portfolio management (discretionary authority, rebalancing, tactical changes, implementation); duties and responsibilities; and an appendix for additional details. Two primary approaches to constructing a client portfolio are a traditional approach and a goals-based investing approach. Portfolio reporting involves periodically providing clients with information about their investment portfolio and performance. Portfolio review refers to meetings or phone conversations between a wealth manager and a client to discuss the client’s investment strategy. The key difference between portfolio reporting and portfolio review is that the wealth manager is more actively engaged in a review. The success of an investment program involves achieving client goals, following a consistent process, and realizing favorable portfolio performance. Ethical considerations for private wealth managers include “know your customer” (KYC), fiduciary duty and suitability, confidentiality, and conflicts of interest. Several global regulations have relevance for private wealth managers. Key private wealth segments include mass affluent, high net worth, and ultra high net worth. Robo-advisors have emerged in the mass affluent client segment. These advisors have a primarily digital client interface. Robo-advisor service providers generally charge lower fees than traditional wealth management firms. Scalability of technology has enabled robo-advisors to service investors with relatively small portfolios.

This reading introduces ideas and concepts that will help you understand the importance of ethical behavior in the investment industry. You will be introduced to various types of ethical issues within the investment profession and learn about the CFA Institute Code of Ethics. The readings covering ethics and professional standards demonstrate that ethical behavior is central to creating trust. Professional behavior is equally important. Professions help maintain trust in an industry by establishing codes and setting standards that put a framework around ethical behavior and technical competence. Professions also set the wider goal of gaining and maintaining the trust of society as a whole. In this regard, professions have a sense of purpose that society values. Imagine that you are employed in the research department of a large financial services firm. You and your colleagues spend your days researching, analyzing, and valuing the shares of publicly traded companies and sharing your investment recommendations with clients. You love your work and take great satisfaction in knowing that your recommendations can help the firm’s investing clients make informed investment decisions that will help them meet their financial goals and improve their lives. Several months after starting at the firm, you learn that an analyst at the firm has been terminated for writing and publishing research reports that misrepresented the fundamental risks of some companies to investors. You learn that the analyst wrote the reports with the goal of pleasing the management of the companies that were the subjects of the research reports. He hoped that these companies would hire your firm’s investment banking division for its services and he would be rewarded with large bonuses for helping the firm increase its investment banking fees. Some clients bought shares based on the analyst’s reports and suffered losses. They posted stories on the internet about their losses and the misleading nature of the reports. When the media investigated and published the story, the firm’s reputation for investment research suffered. Investors began to question the firm’s motives and the objectivity of its research recommendations. The firm’s investment clients started to look elsewhere for investment advice, and company clients begin to transfer their business to firms with untarnished reputations. With business declining, management is forced to trim staff. Along with many other hard-working colleagues, you lose your job—through no fault of your own. Imagine how you would feel in this situation. Most people would feel upset and resentful that their hard and honest work was derailed by someone else’s unethical behavior. Yet, this type of scenario is not uncommon. Around the world, unsuspecting employees at such companies as SAC Capital, Stanford Financial Group, Everbright Securities, Enron, Satyam Computer Services, Arthur Andersen, and other large companies have experienced such career setbacks when someone else’s actions destroyed trust in their companies and industries. Businesses and financial markets thrive on trust—defined as a strong belief in the reliability of a person or institution. In a 2016 study on trust, investors indicated that to earn their trust, the top two attributes of an investment manager should be that it (1) has transparent and open business practices, and (2) has ethical business practices. Although these attributes are valued by customers and clients in any industry, this reading will explore why they are of particular importance to the investment industry. People may think that ethical behavior is simply about following laws, regulations, and other rules, but throughout our lives and careers we will encounter situations in which there is no definitive rule that specifies how to act, or the rules that exist may be unclear or even in conflict with each other. Responsible people, including investment professionals, must be willing and able to identify potential ethical issues and create solutions to them even in the absence of clearly stated rules.","The member should be able to: explain ethics; describe the role of a code of ethics in defining a profession; describe professions and how they establish trust; describe the need for high ethical standards in investment management; explain professionalism in investment management; identify challenges to ethical behavior; distinguish between ethical and legal standards; describe a framework for ethical decision making.
Ethics refers to the study of making good choices. Ethics encompasses a set of moral principles and rules of conduct that provide guidance for our behavior. Situational influences are external factors that may shape our behavior. Challenges to ethical behavior include being overconfident in our own morality, underestimating the effect of situational influences, and focusing on the immediate rather than long-term outcomes or consequences of a decision. In any given profession, the code of ethics publicly communicates the established principles and expected behavior of its members. Members of a profession use specialized knowledge and skills to serve others; they share and agree to adhere to a common code of ethics to serve others and advance the profession. A code of ethics helps foster public confidence that members of the profession will use their specialized skills and knowledge to serve their clients and others. A profession is an occupational group that has specific education, expert knowledge, and a framework of practice and behavior that underpins community trust, respect, and recognition. The requirement to uphold high ethical standards is one clear difference between professions and craft guilds or trade bodies. A primary goal of professions is to establish trust among clients and among society in general. Common characteristics of professions include normalization of practitioner behavior, service to society, client focus, high entry standards, a body of expert knowledge, encouragement and facilitation of continuing education, monitoring of professional conduct, collegiality, recognized overseeing bodies, and encouragement of member engagement. The investment management profession has become increasingly global, driven by the opening of capital markets, coordination of regulation across borders, and the emergence of technology. Investment management professionals are trusted to draw on a body of formal knowledge and apply that knowledge with care and judgement. In comparison to clients, investment professionals are also expected to have superior financial expertise, technical knowledge, and knowledge of the applicable laws and regulations. As a professional body, CFA Institute gathers knowledge from practicing investment professionals, conducts rigorous examinations, and ensures practitioner involvement in developing its codes and values. Investment management professionals are likely to encounter dilemmas, including those with ethical implications. Professionals should consider carefully how to determine the facts of the issue and assess the implications. High ethical standards always matter and are of particular importance in the investment management profession, which is based almost entirely on trust. Clients trust investment professionals to use their specialized skills and knowledge to serve clients and protect client assets. All stakeholders gain long-term benefits when investment professionals adhere to high ethical standards. Legal standards are often rule based. Ethical conduct goes beyond legal standards, balancing self-interest with the direct and indirect consequences of behavior on others. A framework for ethical decision making can help people look at and evaluate a decision from different perspectives, enabling them to identify important issues, make wise decisions, and limit unintended consequences.

On a global basis, institutional investors represent more than US$70 trillion in investable assets, and, as such, wield significant influence over capital markets. The universe of institutional investors includes, but is not limited to, defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, foundations, banks, and insurance companies. Pension plans, which account for approximately US$35 trillion in investable assets or roughly half of global institutional assets under management, include both defined benefit plans, in which the sponsor (employer) assumes investment risk, and defined contribution plans, in which the individual makes investment decisions and assumes the investment risk. Sovereign wealth funds, which account for about US$7 trillion in assets as of the end of 2016, are government-owned investment funds that invest in financial and/or real assets. Endowments and foundations, which account for approximately US$1.6 trillion in assets, manage assets on behalf of educational institutions, hospitals, churches, museums, and other charitable organizations. Banks and insurance companies, comprising net financial assets on the order of US$9 trillion, are financial intermediaries that balance portfolios of securities, loans, and derivatives for the purposes of (i) meeting the claims of depositors, counterparties, policyholders, and creditors and (ii) providing adequate returns to their contractual capital holders. The universe of institutional investors is comprised of large, complex, and sophisticated investors that must contend with a multitude of investment challenges and constraints. There has been an important shift in the asset allocation of institutional investors over the last half century. In the 1970s, most pensions and endowments invested almost exclusively in domestic, fixed-income instruments. In the 1980s, many institutional investors began to invest in equity markets and often pursued a long-term strategic allocation of 60% equities/40% fixed income. In the 1990s, investors recognized the benefits of diversification and many made their first forays into international equity markets. At the turn of the 21st century, many of the world’s largest pension funds and endowments further diversified their portfolios and increased investments in alternative asset classes, including private equity, hedge funds, real estate, and other alternative or illiquid assets. Meanwhile, institutional investors have seen broad shifts in their strategic investment behavior. The trend toward Liability Driven Investing (LDI), long a mainstay of banks and insurance companies, has taken hold among many defined benefit pension plans, particularly US corporate and public pension funds. Sovereign wealth funds have amassed significant assets over the past several decades, and many have implemented innovative investment approaches characterized by active management. Many endowments have adopted the “Endowment Model” of investing that involves significant exposure to alternative investments. Meanwhile, banks and insurers must navigate a complex and ever-changing economic and regulatory environment. In this reading, we endeavor to put the numerous factors that affect investment by institutional investors into context. Section 2 discusses common characteristics of institutional investors as a group. Section 3 provides an overview of investment policies for institutional investors. Detailed coverage by institutional investor type begins with Section 4, pension funds, where we discuss various factors that influence investments, including: stakeholders, liability streams, investment horizons, and liquidity needs; major legal, regulatory, accounting, and tax constraints; investment objectives and key components of Investment Policy Statements; and, finally, asset allocation and investment portfolios that emanate from the foregoing factors and constraints. Section 5 follows the same approach for sovereign wealth funds, and Section 6 does the same for university endowments and private foundations. Section 7 covers banks and insurers and includes balance sheet management considerations. A summary of key points concludes the reading.","The member should be able to: discuss common characteristics of institutional investors as a group; discuss investment policy of institutional investors; discuss the stakeholders in the portfolio, the liabilities, the investment time horizons, and the liquidity needs of different types of institutional investors; describe the focus of legal, regulatory, and tax constraints affecting different types of institutional investors; evaluate risk considerations of private defined benefit (DB) pension plans in relation to 1) plan funded status, 2) sponsor financial strength, 3) interactions between the sponsor’s business and the fund’s investments, 4) plan design, and 5) workforce characteristics; prepare the investment objectives section of an institutional investor’s investment policy statement; evaluate the investment policy statement of an institutional investor; evaluate the investment portfolio of a private DB plan, sovereign wealth fund, university endowment, and private foundation; describe considerations affecting the balance sheet management of banks and insurers.","This reading has introduced the subject of managing institutional investor portfolios. The key points made in this reading are as follows: The main institutional investor types are pension plans, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, foundations, banks, and insurance companies. Common characteristics among these investors include a large scale (i.e., asset size), a long-term investment horizon, regulatory constraints, a clearly defined governance framework, and principal–agent issues. Institutional investors typically codify their mission, investment objectives, and guidelines in an Investment Policy Statement (IPS). Four common investment approaches to managing portfolios used by institutional investors are the Norway model, the Endowment model, the Canada model, and the Liability Driven Investing (LDI) model. There are two main types of pension plans: defined benefit (DB), in which a plan sponsor commits to paying a specified retirement benefit; and defined contribution (DC), in which contributions are defined but the ultimate retirement benefit is not specified or guaranteed by the plan sponsor. Pension plan stakeholders include the employer, employees, retirees, unions, management, the investment committee and/or board of directors, and shareholders. The key elements in the calculation of DB plan liabilities are as follows: Service/tenure: The higher the service years, the higher the retirement benefit. Salary/earnings: The higher the salary over the measurement period, the higher the retirement benefit. Mortality/longevity: The longer the participant’s expected life span, the higher the plan sponsor’s liability. Vesting: Lower turnover results in higher vesting, increasing the plan sponsor’s liabilities. Discount rate: A higher discount rate reduces the present value of the plan sponsor’s liabilities. DB plan liquidity needs are driven by the following: Proportion of active employees relative to retirees: More mature pension funds have higher liquidity needs. Age of workforce: Liquidity needs rise as the age of the workforce increases. Plan funded status: If the plan is well funded, the sponsor may reduce contributions, generating a need to hold higher balances of liquid assets to pay benefits. Flexibility: Ability of participants to switch among the sponsor’s plans or to withdraw from the plan. Pension plans are subject to significant and evolving regulatory constraints designed to ensure the integrity, adequacy, and sustainability of the pension system. Some incentives, such as tax exemption, are only granted to plans that meet these regulatory requirements. Notable differences in legal, regulatory, and tax considerations can lead to differences in plan design from one country to another or from one group to another (e.g., public plans vs. corporate plans). The following risk considerations affect the way DB plans are managed: Plan funded status Sponsor financial strength Interactions between the sponsor’s business and the fund’s investments Plan design Workforce characteristics An examination of pension fund asset allocations shows very large differences in average asset allocations by country and within a country despite these plans seeking to achieve similar goals. Such inter- and intra-national differences are driven by many factors, including the differences in legal, regulatory, accounting, and tax constraints; the investment objectives, risk appetites, and investment views of the stakeholders; the liabilities to and demographics of the ultimate beneficiaries; the availability of suitable investment opportunities; and the expected cost of living in retirement. The major types of sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) follow: Budget Stabilization funds: Set up to insulate the budget and economy from commodity price volatility and external shocks. Development funds: Established to allocate resources to priority socioeconomic projects, usually infrastructure. Savings funds: Intended to share wealth across generations by transforming non-renewable assets into diversified financial assets. Reserve funds: Intended to reduce the negative carry costs of holding foreign currency reserves or to earn higher return on ample reserves. Pension Reserve funds: Set up to meet identified future outflows with respect to pension-related, contingent-type liabilities on governments’ balance sheets. Stakeholders of SWFs include the country’s citizens, the government, external asset managers, and the SWF’s management, investment committee and board of directors. Given their mission of intergenerational wealth transfer, SWFs do not generally have clearly defined liabilities, so do not typically pursue asset/liability matching strategies used by other institutional investor types. Sovereign wealth funds have differing liquidity needs. Budget stabilization funds require the most liquidity, followed by reserve funds. At the other end of the spectrum are savings funds with low liquidity needs, followed by pension reserve funds. The investment objectives of SWFs are often clearly articulated in the legislative instruments that create them. They are often tax free in their home country, though must take foreign taxation into consideration. Given their significant asset sizes and the nature of their stakeholders, SWFs have aimed to increase transparency regarding their investment activities. In this regard, the Santiago Principles are a form of self-regulation. The typical asset allocation by SWF type shows budget stabilization funds are invested mainly in bonds and cash given their liquidity needs. Reserve Funds invest in equities and alternatives but maintain a significant allocation of bonds for liquidity. Savings funds and pension reserve funds hold relatively higher allocations of equities and alternatives because of their longer-term liabilities. Endowments and foundations typically invest to maintain purchasing power while financing their supporting university (endowments) or making grants (foundations) in perpetuity—based on the notion of intergenerational equity. Endowments and foundations usually have a formal spending policy that determines how much is paid out annually to support their mission. This future stream of payouts represents their liabilities. For endowments, other liability-related factors to be considered when setting investment policy are: 1) the ability to raise additional funds from donors/alumni, 2) the percentage of the university’s operating budget provided by the endowment, and 3) the ability to issue debt. Foundations and endowments typically enjoy tax-exempt status and face relatively little regulation compared to other types of institutional investors. Foundations face less flexible spending rules compared to endowments; foundations in the US are legally mandated to pay out 5% of their assets annually to maintain tax-exempt status. Endowments and foundations have relatively low liquidity needs. However, foundations have somewhat higher liquidity needs (vs. endowments), because they 1) typically pay out slightly more as a percentage of assets, and 2) finance the entire operating budget of the organization they support. Endowments and foundations typically have a long-term real return objective of about 5% consistent with their spending policies. This real return objective, and a desire to maintain purchasing power, results in endowments and foundations making significant allocations to real assets. In general, endowments and foundations invest heavily in private asset classes and hedge funds and have relatively small allocations to fixed income. Banking and insurance companies manage both portfolio assets and institutional liabilities to achieve an extremely high probability that obligations on deposits, guarantees, derivatives, policyholder claims, and other liabilities will be paid in full and on time. Banking and insurance companies have perpetual time horizons. Strategically, their goal is to maximize net present value to capital holders; tactically, this may be achieved by liability driven investing (LDI) over intermediate and shorter horizons. Financial institutions are highly regulated because of their importance to the non-financial, or real, sectors of the economy. Such institutions are also regulated in order to minimize contagion risk rippling throughout the financial and real sectors. The underlying premise of regulation is that an institution’s capital must be adequate to absorb shocks to both asset and liability values. This implies limiting the volatility of value of the institution’s shareholder capital. The volatility of shareholder capital can be managed by (a) reducing the price volatility of portfolio investments, loans, and derivatives; (b) lowering the volatility from unexpected shocks to claims, deposits, guarantees, and other liabilities; (c) limiting leverage; and (d) attempting to achieve positive correlation between changes in the value of assets and liabilities. Ample liquidity, diversification of portfolio and other assets, high investment quality, transparency, stable funding, duration management, diversification of insurance underwriting risks, and monetary limits on guarantees, funding commitments, and insurance claims are some of the ways management and regulators attempt to achieve low volatility of shareholder capital value.

Whether the intermediary is a separately managed account or a pooled investment vehicle, such as mutual funds in the United States, unit trusts in the United Kingdom, Undertakings for the Collective Investment of Transferable Securities (UCITS) in the European Union, hedge funds, private equity funds, or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a professional investment manager is being entrusted with helping investors achieve their investment objectives. In all of these cases, the selection of appropriate investment managers is a challenge with important financial consequences. Evaluating an investment manager is a complex and detailed process that encompasses a great deal more than analyzing investment returns. The investigation and analysis in support of an investment action, decision, or recommendation is called due diligence . In conducting investment manager due diligence, the focus is on understanding how the investment results were achieved and on assessing the likelihood that the investment process that generated these returns will produce superior or at least satisfactory investment results going forward. Due diligence also entails an evaluation of a firm’s integrity, operations, and personnel. As such, due diligence involves both quantitative and qualitative analysis. This reading provides a framework that introduces and describes the important elements of the manager selection process. Although it is important to have a well-defined methodology, this reading is not intended to be a rigid checklist, a step-by-step guide, or an in-depth analysis but rather to present a structure from which the reader can develop their own approach. We assume that the investment policy statement (IPS) has been drafted, the asset allocation determined, and the decision to use an outside adviser has been made. As a result, the focus is on determining which manager offers the “best” means to implement or express those decisions. The discussion has three broad topics: Outlining a framework for identifying, evaluating, and ultimately selecting investment managers (Section 2). Quantitative considerations in manager selection (Section 3). Qualitative considerations in manager selection (Section 4). The reading concludes with a summary of selected important points.","The member should be able to: describe the components of a manager selection process, including due diligence; contrast Type I and Type II errors in manager hiring and continuation decisions; describe uses of returns-based and holdings-based style analysis in investment manager selection; describe uses of the upside capture ratio, downside capture ratio, maximum drawdown, drawdown duration, and up/down capture in evaluating managers; evaluate a manager’s investment philosophy and investment decision-making process; evaluate the costs and benefits of pooled investment vehicles and separate accounts; compare types of investment manager contracts, including their major provisions and advantages and disadvantages; describe the three basic forms of performance-based fees; analyze and interpret a sample performance-based fee schedule.","Evaluating an investment manager is a complex and detailed process. It encompasses a great deal more than analyzing investment returns. In conducting investment manager due diligence, the focus is on understanding how the investment results were achieved and assessing the likelihood that the manager will continue to follow the same investment process that generated these returns. This process also entails operational due diligence, including an evaluation of the integrity of the firm, its operations, and personnel, as well as evaluating the vehicle structure and terms. As such, due diligence involves both quantitative and qualitative analysis. This reading provides a framework that introduces and describes the important elements of the manager selection process: Investment manager selection involves a broad set of qualitative and quantitative considerations to determine whether a manager displays skill and the likelihood that the manager will continue to display skill in the future. The qualitative analysis consists of investment due diligence, which evaluates the manager’s investment process, investment personnel, and portfolio construction; and operational due diligence, which evaluates the manager’s infrastructure. A Type I error is hiring or retaining a manager who subsequently underperforms expectations—that is, rejecting the null hypothesis of no skill when it is correct. A Type II error is not hiring or firing a manager who subsequently outperforms, or performs in line with, expectations—that is, not rejecting the null hypothesis when it is incorrect. The manager search and selection process has three broad components: the universe, a quantitative analysis of the manager’s performance track record, and a qualitative analysis of the manager’s investment process. The qualitative analysis includes both investment due diligence and operational due diligence. Capture ratio measures the asymmetry of returns, and a ratio greater than 1 indicates greater participation in rising versus falling markets. Drawdown is the loss incurred in any continuous period of negative returns. The investment philosophy is the foundation of the investment process. The philosophy outlines the set of assumptions about the factors that drive performance and the manager’s beliefs about their ability to successfully exploit these sources of return. The investment manager should have a clear and concise investment philosophy. It is important to evaluate these assumptions and the role they play in the investment process to understand how the strategy will behave over time and across market environments. The investment process has to be consistent and appropriate for the philosophy, and the investment personnel need to possess sufficient expertise and experience to effectively execute the investment process. Style analysis, understanding the manager’s risk exposures relative to the benchmark, is an important component of performance appraisal and manager selection, helping to define the universe of suitable managers. Returns-based style analysis is a top-down approach that involves estimating the risk exposures from an actual return series for a given period. Although RBSA adds an additional analytical step, the analysis is straightforward and should identify the important drivers of return and risk factors for the period analyzed. It can be estimated even for complicated strategies and is comparable across managers and through time. The disadvantage is that RBSA is an imprecise tool, attributing performance to an unchanging average portfolio during the period that might not reflect the current or future portfolio exposures. Holdings-based style analysis is a bottom-up approach that estimates the risk exposures from the actual securities held in the portfolio at a point in time. HBSA allows for the estimation of current risk factors and should identify all important drivers of return and risk factors, be comparable across managers and through time, and provide an accurate view of the manager’s risk exposures. The disadvantages are the additional computational effort, dependence on the degree of transparency provided by the manager, and the possibility that accuracy may be compromised by stale pricing and window dressing. The prospectus, private placement memorandum, and/or limited partnership agreement are, in essence, the contract between the investor and the manager, outlining each party’s rights and responsibilities. The provisions are liquidity terms and fees. Limited liquidity reduce the investor’s flexibility to adjust portfolio allocations in light of changing market conditions or investor circumstances. On the other hand, limited liquidity allows the funds to take long-term views and hold less liquid securities with reduced risk of having to divest assets at inopportune times in response to redemption requests. A management fee lowers the level of realized return without affecting the standard deviation, whereas a performance fee has the added effect of lowering the realized standard deviation. The preference is for more-linear compensation to reduce the incentives to change the portfolio’s risk profile at inflection points. The choice between individual separate accounts and pooled (or commingled) vehicles is dependent upon the consistency with the investment process, the suitability for the investor IPS, and whether the benefits outweigh the additional costs. Investment management fees take one of two forms: a fixed percentage fee based on assets under management or a performance-based fee which charges a percentage of the portfolio’s total return or excess return over a benchmark or hurdle rate. Performance-based fees work to align the interests of managers and investors because both parties share in investment results. Most managers that charge a performance fee also charge some level of fixed percentage fee to aid business continuity efforts. Fee structures must be designed carefully to avoid favoring one party over the other.

The 2020 edition of the GIPS standards contains three chapters: the GIPS Standards for Firms, the GIPS Standards for Asset Owners, and the GIPS Standards for Verifiers, each with its own glossary. Candidates are responsible not only for the material contained directly in this reading but also for the sections of the GIPS Standards for Firms specifically referenced within this reading. The entirety of the 2020 GIPS Standards for Firms can be found here: https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/ethics/codes/gips-standards/firms The GIPS standards fulfill an essential role in investment management around the world. They meet the need for globally accepted standards for investment management firms in calculating and presenting their investment returns to prospective clients and prospective investors . (In the context of the GIPS Standards for Firms, a prospective client is any person or entity that has expressed interest in one of the firm’s strategies and qualifies to invest in that strategy via a segregated account, irrespective of whether the person or entity currently invests with the firm through another strategy that the firm offers. A prospective investor is any person or entity that has expressed interest in one of the firm’s pooled funds and qualifies to invest in the pooled fund, again irrespective of any other current investments with the firm. These and other terms bolded in this reading are defined in the glossary of the GIPS Standards for Firms. For purposes of this reading, the terms client and investor may be used interchangeably.) The GIPS standards are based on the ideals of fair representation and full disclosure of an investment management firm’s performance history. Firms that claim compliance with the GIPS standards must adhere to rules governing not only return calculations but also the way in which returns are displayed in a GIPS Report . (A GIPS Report is a specific type of performance presentation that must be provided to prospective clients and investors when a firm claims compliance with the GIPS standards.) They are further required to make certain disclosures and are encouraged to make others in a GIPS Report, thereby assisting the user in interpreting and evaluating the reported returns. Prospective and current clients can have a high degree of confidence that the information shown in a GIPS Report reflects the results of the firm’s past investment decisions. They can also be confident that the returns are calculated and presented on a consistent basis and are objectively comparable for a given strategy with those reported by other firms claiming compliance with the GIPS standards.","The member should be able to: discuss the objectives and scope of the GIPS standards and their benefits to prospective clients and investors, as well as investment managers; explain the fundamentals of compliance with the GIPS standards, including the definition of the firm and the firm’s definition of discretion; discuss requirements of the GIPS standards with respect to return calculation methodologies, including the treatment of external cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, and expenses and fees; explain requirements of the GIPS standards with respect to composite return calculations, including methods for asset-weighting portfolio returns; explain the meaning of “discretionary” in the context of composite construction and, given a description of the relevant facts, determine whether a portfolio is likely to be considered discretionary; explain the role of investment mandates, objectives, or strategies in the construction of composites; explain requirements of the GIPS standards with respect to composite construction, including switching portfolios among composites, the timing of the inclusion of new portfolios in composites, and the timing of the exclusion of terminated portfolios from composites; explain requirements of the GIPS standards with respect to presentation and reporting; explain the conditions under which the performance of a past firm or affiliation may be linked to or used to represent the historical performance of a new or acquiring firm; explain the recommended valuation hierarchy of the GIPS standards; discuss the purpose, scope, and process of verification.","The Global Investment Performance Standards for Firms meet the need for globally accepted standards for investment management firms in calculating and presenting their results to clients and prospective clients. The GIPS standards will continue to evolve to address additional aspects of performance presentation. Firms that claim compliance must meet all applicable requirements, including not only the provisions of the GIPS standards but also any Guidance Statements, interpretations, and Questions & Answers published by CFA Institute and the GIPS standards governing bodies. Practitioners should register for the GIPS Newsletter to stay informed about existing and new requirements and recommended best practices. CFA Institute and other organizations offer publications and conduct conferences and workshops designed to help practitioners implement and maintain compliance with the GIPS standards. This reading has made the following points: Only investment management firms and asset owners that manage assets on a discretionary basis—and compete for business—may claim compliance with the GIPS Standards for Firms. The objectives of the GIPS standards are as follows: (1) Promote investor interests and instill investor confidence; (2) ensure accurate and consistent data; (3) obtain worldwide acceptance of a single standard for calculating and presenting performance; (4) promote fair, global competition among investment firms; and (5) promote industry self-regulation on a global basis. When the GIPS standards conflict with law and/or regulations regarding the calculation and presentation of performance, firms must comply with the law or regulations and disclose the conflict in the GIPS Report. Required fundamentals of compliance with the GIPS standards include properly defining the firm, providing GIPS Reports to all prospective clients/investors, adhering to applicable laws and regulations, and ensuring that information presented is not false or misleading. A “firm” is an investment firm, subsidiary, or division held out to the public as a distinct business entity. A composite is an aggregation of one or more portfolios managed according to a similar investment mandate, objective, or strategy. The composite return is the weighted average of the return of all portfolios in the composite. All discretionary, fee-paying, segregated accounts must be included in at least one composite. All discretionary, fee-paying pooled funds must be included in any composite for which they meet the composite definition. A portfolio is discretionary if the firm is able to implement the intended investment strategy. Firms must formulate, document, and adhere to composite- and pooled fund–specific policies for the treatment of external cash flows and to adhere to those policies consistently. The GIPS standards mandate the use of certain calculation methodologies to facilitate comparability of results among firms. Time-weighted returns are required for all portfolios except portfolios meeting certain criteria. Money-weighted returns may be presented instead of time-weighted returns if the firm has control over the external cash flows into the portfolios in the composite or the pooled fund and at least one of the following conditions is met: the portfolios in the composite are (or the pooled fund is): 1) closed-end; 2) fixed life; 3) fixed commitment; or 4) have illiquid investments as a significant part of the investment strategy. Returns for periods of less than one year must not be annualized. Returns from cash and cash equivalents must be included in all total return calculations. Returns must be calculated after the deduction of transaction costs. Assets must be valued using a fair value methodology. If objective, observable, unadjusted quoted market prices for identical investments in active markets on the measurement date are available, they must be used. If they are not available, firms may use, in this order: (1) quoted prices for similar investments in markets that are active; (2) quoted prices for identical or similar investments in markets that are not active; (3) market-based inputs, other than quoted prices, that are observable for the investment; or (4) subjective, unobservable inputs. A firm must have a clear, written definition of discretion that is consistently applied. Firms may not link the theoretical performance of simulated or model portfolios with actual performance. GIPS Composite Reports that present TWRs must include the following key items: at least five years of annual performance (unless the composite has been in existence for a shorter period), building to a minimum of 10 years of returns; composite and benchmark annual returns for all years; the number of portfolios (if six or more) in the composite at each period end; the amount of assets in the composite; the amount of total firm assets at the end of each period; a measure of internal dispersion of individual portfolio returns for each annual period and, where monthly returns are available; and the three-year annualized ex post standard deviation of the composite and of the benchmark as of each annual period end. Performance from a past firm or affiliation may be linked to the performance of the new or acquiring firm if (1) substantially all the investment decision makers are employed by the new or acquiring firm, (2) the decision-making process remains substantially intact and independent within the new or acquiring firm, (3) the new or acquiring firm has records that document and support the reported performance, and (4) there is no break in the track record between the past firm or affiliation and the new or acquiring firm. Verification provides assurance on whether the firm’s policies and procedures related to composite and pooled fund maintenance, as well as the calculation, presentation, and distribution of performance have been designed in compliance with the GIPS standards and have been implemented on a firm-wide basis. Verifiers must determine if the firm satisfies the GIPS standards requirements with respect to recordkeeping, policies and procedures, the definition of the firm, the completeness of the list of composites and limited distribution pooled fund descriptions, and the calculation of total firm assets. A verification report may be issued only with respect to the whole firm.

The problem with focusing on individual securities is that this approach may lead to the investor “putting all her eggs in one basket.” Portfolios provide important diversification benefits, allowing risk to be reduced without necessarily affecting or compromising return. Understanding the needs of your client and preparing an investment policy statement represent the first steps of the portfolio management process. Those steps are followed by asset allocation, security analysis, portfolio construction, portfolio monitoring and rebalancing, and performance measurement and reporting. Types of investors include individual and institutional investors. Institutional investors include defined benefit pension plans, endowments and foundations, banks, insurance companies, and sovereign wealth funds. The asset management industry is an integral component of the global financial services sector. Asset managers offer either active management, passive management, or both. Asset managers are typically categorized as traditional or alternative, although the line between traditional and alternative has blurred. Three key trends in the asset management industry include the growth of passive investing, “big data” in the investment process, and robo-advisers in the wealth management industry. Investors use different types of investment products in their portfolios. These include mutual funds, separately managed accounts, exchange-traded funds, hedge funds, and private equity and venture capital funds.

Life-cycle finance is concerned with helping investors achieve their goals, including an adequate retirement income, by taking a holistic view of the individual’s financial situation as he or she moves through life. Individuals are exposed to a range of risks over their lives: They may become disabled, suffer a prolonged illness, die prematurely, or outlive their resources. In addition, from an investment perspective, the assets of individuals could decline in value or provide an inadequate return in relation to financial needs and aspirations. All of these risks have two things in common: They are typically random, and they can result in financial hardship without an appropriate risk management strategy. Risk management for individuals is distinct from risk management for corporations given the distinctive characteristics of households, which include the finite and unknown lifespan of individuals, the frequent preference for stable spending among individuals, and the desire to pass on wealth to heirs (i.e., through bequests). To protect against unexpected financial hardships, risks must be identified, market and non-market solutions considered, and a plan developed and implemented. A well-constructed plan for risk management will involve the selection of financial products and investment strategies that fit an individual’s financial goals and mitigate the risk of shortfalls. In this reading, we provide an overview of the potential risks to an individual or household, an analysis of products and strategies that can protect against some of these risks, and a discussion regarding the selection of an appropriate product or strategy. Following the introduction, Section 2 provides an overview of human and financial capital. Section 3 addresses the process of risk management, the financial stages of life for an individual, the economic (or holistic) balance sheet, and individual risks and risk exposures. Section 4 discusses the types of products relevant to financial planning, including insurance and annuities. Section 5 contains an insurance program case study and insights on implementing risk management solutions for individuals. Section 6 summarizes the key points of the reading.","The member should be able to: compare the characteristics of human capital and financial capital as components of an individual’s total wealth; discuss the relationships among human capital, financial capital, and economic net worth; discuss the financial stages of life for an individual; describe an economic (holistic) balance sheet; discuss risks (earnings, premature death, longevity, property, liability, and health risks) in relation to human and financial capital; describe types of insurance relevant to personal financial planning; describe the basic elements of a life insurance policy and how insurers price a life insurance policy; discuss the use of annuities in personal financial planning; discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of fixed and variable annuities; analyze and critique an insurance program; discuss how asset allocation policy may be influenced by the risk characteristics of human capital; recommend and justify appropriate strategies for asset allocation and risk reduction when given an investor profile of key inputs.","The risk management process for individuals is complex given the variety of potential risks that may be experienced over the life cycle and the differences that exist across households. In this reading, key concepts related to risk management and individuals include the following: The two primary asset types for most individuals can be described broadly as human capital and financial capital. Human capital is the net present value of the individual’s future expected labor income, whereas financial capital consists of assets currently owned by the individual and can include such items as a bank account, individual securities, pooled funds, a retirement account, and a home. Economic net worth is an extension of traditional balance sheet net worth that includes claims to future assets that can be used for consumption, such as human capital, as well as the present value of pension benefits. There are typically four key steps in the risk management process for individuals: Specify the objective, identify risks, evaluate risks and select appropriate methods to manage the risks, and monitor outcomes and risk exposures and make appropriate adjustments in methods. The financial stages of life for adults can be categorized in the following seven periods: education phase, early career, career development, peak accumulation, pre-retirement, early retirement, and late retirement. The primary goal of an economic (holistic) balance sheet is to arrive at an accurate depiction of an individual’s overall financial health by accounting for the present value of all available marketable and non-marketable assets, as well as all liabilities. An economic (holistic) balance sheet includes traditional assets and liabilities, as well as human capital and pension value, as assets and includes consumption and bequests as liabilities. The total economic wealth of an individual changes throughout his or her lifetime, as do the underlying assets that make up that wealth. The total economic wealth of younger individuals is typically dominated by the value of their human capital. As individuals age, earnings will accumulate, increasing financial capital. Earnings risk refers to the risks associated with the earnings potential of an individual—that is, events that could negatively affect someone’s human and financial capital. Premature death risk relates to the death of an individual, such as a family member, whose future earnings (human capital) were expected to help pay for the financial needs and aspirations of the family. Longevity risk is the risk of reaching an age at which one’s income and financial assets are insufficient to provide adequate support. Property risk relates to the possibility that one’s property may be damaged, destroyed, stolen, or lost. There are different types of property insurance, depending on the asset, such as automobile insurance and homeowner’s insurance. Liability risk refers to the possibility that an individual or other entity may be held legally liable for the financial costs of property damage or physical injury. Health risk refers to the risks and implications associated with illness or injury. Health risks manifest themselves in different ways over the life cycle and can have significant implications for human capital. The primary purpose of life insurance is to help replace the economic value of an individual to a family or a business in the event of that individual’s death. The family’s need for life insurance is related to the potential loss associated with the future earnings power of that individual. The two main types of life insurance are temporary and permanent. Temporary life insurance, or term life insurance, provides insurance for a certain period of time specified at purchase, whereas permanent insurance, or whole life insurance, is used to provide lifetime coverage, assuming the premiums are paid over the entire period. Fixed annuities provide a benefit that is fixed (or known) for life, whereas variable annuities have a benefit that can change over time and that is generally based on the performance of some underlying portfolio or investment. When selecting between fixed and variable annuities, there are a number of important considerations, such as the volatility of the benefit, flexibility, future market expectations, fees, and inflation concerns. Among the factors that would likely increase demand for an annuity are the following: longer-than-average life expectancy, greater preference for lifetime income, less concern for leaving money to heirs, more conservative investing preferences, and lower guaranteed income from other sources (such as pensions). Techniques for managing a risk include risk avoidance, risk reduction, risk transfer, and risk retention. The most appropriate choice among these techniques often is related to consideration of the frequency and severity of losses associated with the risk. The decision to retain risk or buy insurance is determined by a household’s risk tolerance. At the same level of wealth, a more risk-tolerant household will prefer to retain more risk, either through higher insurance deductibles or by simply not buying insurance, than will a less risk-tolerant household. Insurance products that have a higher load will encourage a household to retain more risk. An individual’s total economic wealth affects portfolio construction through asset allocation, which includes the overall allocation to risky assets, as well as the underlying asset classes, such as stocks and bonds, selected by the individual. Investment risk, property risk, and human capital risk can be either idiosyncratic or systematic. Examples of idiosyncratic risks include the risks of a specific occupation, the risk of living a very long life or experiencing a long-term illness, and the risk of premature death or loss of property. Systematic risks affect all households.

We begin with a discussion of taxes. Taxes are an important determinant of the taxable investor’s final returns. While fees and trading costs have received a lot of attention in the press and academic spheres, the erosion of returns due to taxes can be much more significant. Consider this scenario: After significant development and testing, your firm has just launched a new strategy that tactically shifts between different equity indexes. The backtests show significant alpha over most time horizons and especially strong performance during market downturns—a risk/return profile that should be highly attractive to your clients. You launch the strategy 1 January, and everyone is pleased with the performance in the first year. On 15 February of the following year, the founder of the firm receives a telephone call from the accountant for Charles and Ivy Lee, an important private client relationship. The accountant has been compiling the Lees’ tax documents in preparation for filing the annual tax return. It seems that the trading activity inherent in your new strategy has generated a lot of capital gains, and the resulting tax bill is larger than the excess returns generated by your strategy! This scenario is not uncommon. Because a significant proportion of actively managed assets is managed on behalf of tax-exempt institutions, such as retirement plans and sovereign wealth funds, strategies are often developed either without regard to taxes or with taxes as an afterthought and then applied—unsuccessfully—to taxable investors. To illustrate the effect of taxes on wealth accumulation, let’s examine a longer time horizon. The S&P 500 Index from 1 January 1990 through 30 June 2019 appreciated 7.5% per year, on average. With dividends reinvested and ignoring fees and transaction costs, the compound annual growth rate would have been 9.8%. If the Lees had invested $1 million on 1 January 1990, we would expect their portfolio to have grown to $16 million by the end of the nearly 30-year period. However, this is only true if the assets are not subject to taxation during the accumulation phase, as would be the case if they are held in a retirement account or a private family foundation. If we assume the worst case, that both dividends and capital gains are taxed fully at a marginal tax rate of 50%, then the 9.8% compound annual growth rate would be cut roughly in half—to 5.0%. In other words, their $1 million would have only grown to $4 million after almost 30 years—only one-fourth of what the tax-exempt account realized. Clearly, taxes are an important investment consideration. Fortunately, as a tax-aware practitioner, you may be able to use various tax-management techniques to reduce the tax drag. If capital gains and dividends are taxed at 25%, the final wealth of the taxable portfolio would have grown to $8 million. If capital gains taxes can be eliminated or deferred and only dividends are taxed at the 25% rate, then the $1 million would have grown to $13 million at the end of our horizon. It is still not as good as the tax-exempt case, but it is significantly better than our worst case. Broadly speaking, a portfolio manager managing assets for a private client looks to maximize after-tax returns for a given level of risk. This reading lays the ground work for understanding how different types of taxes impact wealth accumulation. We review the general principles of taxation, how to measure tax efficiency, and how to reduce the impact of taxes on a portfolio. Hopefully we’ve convinced you why it is important to manage your client’s portfolio with taxes in mind. Tax considerations, however, are just one element of managing assets for private wealth clients. Suppose that only 50% of your private client’s assets are invested in your tax-aware investment strategy. The other 50% of assets are tied up in a company that was the primary source of wealth creation for your client: Ivy Lee started a business in her early 20s that succeeded far beyond her initial expectations. While she has accumulated liquid assets outside of that business, a substantial portion of her net worth is held in company stock. From your earlier readings in the course of the CFA Program, you realize that this is a very risky position. Taken in the aggregate, her portfolio is undiversified; however, to sell the position outright would create an enormous tax liability or lead to a loss of control over the business she created. How, then, do you help the client achieve her goals? This reading discusses some practical tools that you can employ to manage the risk of this concentrated position. Finally, Ivy and Charles want to maximize the likelihood that the strong financial foundation they have created will survive to provide support for their children’s and grandchildren’s future endeavors. Ivy has frequently heard the phrase “shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations,” meaning that family wealth rarely survives beyond three generations. Some variation of that saying exists in many cultures. The Lees want your help to create a structure that will counter that conventional wisdom. While this reading won’t make you an estate planning expert, it will prepare you to identify estate planning opportunities that may help the Lees achieve that goal and to work more effectively with the Lees’ estate planning professionals toward that end.","The member should be able to: compare taxation of income, wealth, and wealth transfers; describe global considerations of jurisdiction that are relevant to taxation; discuss and analyze the tax efficiency of investments; analyze the impact of taxes on capital accumulation and decumulation in taxable, tax-exempt, and tax-deferred accounts; explain portfolio tax management strategies and their application; discuss risk and tax objectives in managing concentrated single-asset positions; describe strategies for managing concentrated positions in public equities; describe strategies for managing concentrated positions in privately owned businesses and real estate; discuss objectives—tax and non-tax—in planning the transfer of wealth; discuss strategies for achieving estate, bequest, and lifetime gift objectives in common law and civil law regimes; describe considerations related to managing wealth across multiple generations.","Even the best private wealth manager will never have all the answers. An effective private wealth manager will, however, be in a position to ask the right questions and consult the right experts to help clients navigate an increasingly complex world. This reading covers important points for managing assets on a tax-aware basis and managing concentrated positions in real estate and private and public equities. It also provides an overview of estate planning. Three foundational elements of investment taxation include: 1) taxation of the components of return, 2) the tax status of the account, and 3) the jurisdiction that applies to the investor (and/or account). Many countries’ tax codes create preferential treatment for some types of dividend and interest income. Long-term capital gains are typically taxed at a lower rate than other forms of income. Income from real estate investments may be reduced by maintenance, interest, and depreciation expenses. Private clients often have a mix of taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-exempt investment accounts. Returns in tax-deferred and tax-exempt accounts compound using the pre-tax rate of return. Tax-deferred accounts pay tax only when assets are withdrawn from the account. Taxable accounts compound using the after-tax rate of return. Broadly speaking, countries may operate under one of three tax regimes: tax havens, territorial tax systems, and worldwide tax systems. A tax haven has no or very low tax rates for foreign investors. A territorial regime taxes only locally-sourced income. A worldwide tax regime taxes all income, regardless of its source. The Common Reporting Standard exists to ensure exchange of financial account information to combat tax evasion. The United States uses FATCA, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, for the same purpose. Equity portfolios are often more tax efficient than strategies that rely on derivatives, real assets, or taxable fixed income. Higher-yield and higher-turnover strategies tend to be less tax efficient. The tax considerations associated with alternative asset classes are more complicated than those associated with stocks and bonds. Measures of tax efficiency include after-tax holding period return, annualized after-tax return, after-tax post-liquidation return, after-tax excess return, and the tax-efficiency ratio. Asset location is the process for determining which assets should be held in each type of account. A general rule of thumb is to put tax-efficient assets in the taxable account and tax-inefficient assets in the tax-exempt or tax-deferred account. The actual solution may differ depending on the strategy and the investor’s horizon. It is typically better to make withdrawals from the taxable account first and then from the tax-deferred accounts. Under progressive tax regimes, it may be more tax efficient to withdraw from the retirement account first until the lowest tax brackets have been fully utilized. Tax avoidance is the legal activity of understanding the tax laws and finding approaches that avoid or minimize taxation. Tax evasion is the illegal concealment and non-payment of taxes that are otherwise due. Tax avoidance strategies include holding assets in a tax-exempt account versus a taxable account, investing in tax-exempt bonds instead of taxable bonds, holding assets long enough to qualify for long-term capital gains treatment, and holding dividend-paying stocks long enough to pay the more favorable tax rate. Tax-deferral strategies include limiting portfolio turnover and the consequent realization of capital gains and tax loss harvesting. The structure of the investment vehicle in which a client’s assets are held may affect the tax liability and the adviser’s ability to manage the client portfolio in a tax-aware manner. In a partnership, the income, realized capital gains, and realized capital losses are passed through to the investors, who are then responsible for any tax liability. In a mutual fund, the income and realized capital gains (but not losses) are passed through to the investors. The taxation of capital gains varies by jurisdiction. Potential capital gain exposure (PCGE) can be used to gauge the amount of tax liability embedded in a mutual fund. Exchange-traded funds are very tax efficient. Separately-managed accounts offer the most flexibility for tax management. Tax loss harvesting is a technique whereby the manager realizes a loss that can be used to offset gains or other income. Tax loss harvesting requires diligent tax lot accounting. Common methods of tax lot accounting are first in, first out (FIFO); last in, first out (LIFO); and highest in, first out (HIFO). A concentrated position subjects the portfolio to a higher level of risk, including unsystematic risk and liquidity risk. Approaches that can be used to mitigate the risks of a concentrated position include sell and diversify; staged diversification; hedging and monetization strategies; tax-free exchanges; tax-deferral strategies; and estate and tax planning strategies, such as charitable trusts, private foundations, and donor-advised funds. A completion portfolio is an index-based portfolio that when added to the concentrated position, creates an overall portfolio with exposures similar to the investor’s benchmark. Equity monetization refers to a group of strategies that allows an investor to receive cash for a stock position without an outright sale. The investor can hedge a part of the position using a short sale, a total return swap, options, futures, or a forward sale contract and then borrow against the hedged position. The loan proceeds are then invested in a diversified portfolio of other investments. Donating the appreciated asset to a charitable remainder trust allows the shares to be sold without incurring a capital gains tax. The trust can then build a diversified portfolio to provide income for the life of the beneficiaries. Strategies to free up capital concentrated in a privately-owned business or real estate include a personal line of credit secured by company shares, leveraged recapitalization, an employee stock ownership plan, mortgage financing, and a charitable trust or donor-advised fund. Estate planning is the process of preparing for the disposition of one’s estate upon death and during one’s lifetime. Objectives of gift and estate planning include maintaining sufficient income and liquidity, achieving the clients’ goals with respect to control over the assets, protection of the assets from creditors, minimization of tax liability, preservation of family wealth, business succession, and achieving charitable goals. An estate tax is the tax on the aggregate value of a deceased person’s assets. It is paid out of the estate. An inheritance tax is paid by each individual beneficiary. A gift tax is paid on a transfer of money or property to another person without receiving at least equal value in return. Many jurisdictions have tax-free allowances that can be used for transferring assets under a certain threshold without paying an estate or inheritance tax. A will outlines the rights others will have over one’s property after death. Probate is the legal process to confirm the validity of the will. Common law jurisdictions give owners the right to use their own judgment regarding the rights others will have over their property after death. Many civil law countries place restrictions on the disposition of an estate, typically giving certain relatives some minimum share of the assets. Common estate planning tools include trusts, foundations, life insurance, and companies. A trust is a legal relationship in which the trustee holds and manages the assets for the benefit of the beneficiaries. A trust can be either revocable or irrevocable. An irrevocable trust generally provides greater asset protection from creditors. A foundation is typically established to hold assets for a specific charitable purpose. The founder can exercise some control in the administration and decision making of the foundation. Life insurance and other forms of insurance can be used to accomplish estate planning objectives. Companies—specifically, a controlled foreign corporation—may allow the owner to defer taxes on income until the earnings are distributed to shareholders or until the company is sold or shares otherwise disposed. Family governance is a process for a family’s collective communication and decision making designed to serve current and future generations. Good family governance establishes principles for collaboration among family members, preserving and growing family’s wealth, and increasing human and financial capital across the generations. A sound family governance system may mitigate many of the behavioral biases that impede effective decision making. Conflict resolution can be particularly challenging in a family context. A family constitution can help wealthy families anticipate possible conflicts and agree on a common set of rights, values, and responsibilities. Managing a concentrated position arising from a family business is more than just an investment issue. The private wealth adviser should be prepared to work with the client in succession planning and post-sale considerations, such as the loss of a key activity that united family members. Effective estate planning requires planning for the unexpected, including divorce and incapacity.

The reading covers a broad range of topics related to trade strategy selection and implementation and trade cost measurement and evaluation. Growth in electronic trading has led to increased automation in trading, including the use of algorithmic trading and machine learning to optimize trade strategy and execution. Various markets, including equities, fixed income, derivatives, and foreign exchange, are examined. Adequate trading processes and procedures are also discussed from a regulatory and governance perspective. Portfolio managers need to work closely with traders to determine the most appropriate trading strategy given their motivation for trading, risk aversion, trade urgency, and other factors, such as order characteristics and market conditions. Trade execution should be well integrated with the portfolio management process, and although trading strategies will vary on the basis of market and security type, all trade activity should be evaluated for execution quality and to assess broker and trade venue performance consistent with the fund’s objectives. Additionally, firms should have proper documentation of trade procedures in place to meet regulatory and governance standards. This reading is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses portfolio manager motivations to trade. Section 3 discusses inputs to trade strategy selection and the trade strategy selection process. Section 4 covers the range of trade implementation choices and trading algorithms and provides a comparison of various markets. Section 5 explains how trade costs are measured and how to evaluate trade execution. Section 6 provides guidance on evaluating a firm’s trading procedures for good governance practices. Section 7 concludes and summarizes the reading.","The member should be able to: discuss motivations to trade and how they relate to trading strategy; discuss inputs to the selection of a trading strategy; compare benchmarks for trade execution; select and justify a trading strategy (given relevant facts); describe factors that typically determine the selection of a trading algorithm class; contrast key characteristics of the following markets in relation to trade implementation: equity, fixed income, options and futures, OTC derivatives, and spot currency; explain how trade costs are measured and determine the cost of a trade; evaluate the execution of a trade; evaluate a firm’s trading procedures, including processes, disclosures, and record keeping with respect to good governance.","Portfolio manager motivations to trade include profit seeking, risk management (hedging), liquidity driven (fund flows), and corporate actions and index reconstitutions. Managers following a short-term alpha-driven strategy will trade with greater urgency to realize alpha before it dissipates (decays). Managers following a longer-term strategy will trade with less urgency if alpha decay is expected to be slower. Trading is required to keep portfolios at targeted risk levels or risk exposures, to hedge risks that may be outside a portfolio manager’s investment objectives or that the portfolio manager does not have an investment view on. Trading may be liquidity driven resulting from client activity or index reconstitutions. In these cases, managers typically trade using end-of-day closing prices because these prices are used for fund and benchmark valuation. Inputs affecting trade strategy selection include the following types: order related, security related, market related, and user based. Order characteristics include the side (or trade direction) and size of an order. Percentage of average daily volume is a standardized measure used in trading that indicates what order size can realistically be traded. Large trades are generally traded over longer time horizons to minimize market impact. Security characteristics include security type, short-term (trade) alpha, security price volatility, and a security’s liquidity profile. Market conditions at the time of trading (intraday trading volumes, bid–ask spreads, and security and market volatility) should be incorporated into trade strategy since they can differ from anticipated conditions. Market volatility and liquidity vary over time, and liquidity considerations may differ substantially during periods of crisis. Individuals with higher levels of risk aversion are more concerned with market risk and tend to trade with greater urgency. Market impact is the adverse price impact in a security caused from trading an order and can represent one of the largest costs in trading. Execution risk is the adverse price impact resulting from a change in the fundamental value of the security and is often proxied by price volatility. Reference price benchmarks inform order trading prices and include pre-trade, intraday, post-trade, and price target benchmarks. Managers seeking short-term alpha will use pre-trade benchmarks, such as the arrival price, when they wish to transact close to current market prices (greater trade urgency). Managers without views on short-term price movements who wish to participate in volumes over the execution horizon typically use an intraday benchmark, such as VWAP or TWAP. Managers of index funds or funds whose valuation is calculated using closing prices typically select the closing price post-trade benchmark to minimize fund risk and tracking error. The primary goal of a trading strategy is to balance the expected costs, risks, and alpha associated with trading the order in a manner consistent with the portfolio manager’s trading objectives, risk aversion, and other known constraints. Execution algorithms can be classified into the following types: scheduled, liquidity seeking, arrival price, dark aggregators, and smart order routers. Equities are traded on exchanges and other multilateral trading venues. Algorithmic trading is common, and most trades are electronic, except for very large trades and trades in illiquid securities. Fixed-income securities are generally traded not on exchanges but in a bilateral, dealer-centric market structure where dealers make markets in the securities. The majority of fixed-income securities are relatively illiquid, especially if they have been issued in prior periods, so-called off-the-run bonds. Most of the trading volume in exchange-traded derivatives is concentrated in futures. Electronic trading is pervasive, and algorithmic trading is growing. OTC derivative markets have historically been opaque, with little public data about prices, trade sizes, and structure details. In recent years, regulators have been placing pressure on OTC markets to introduce central clearing facilities and to display trades publicly in an attempt to increase contract standardization and price discovery and reduce counterparty risk. There is no exchange or centralized clearing place for the majority of spot currency trades. Spot currency markets consist of a number of electronic venues and broker markets. The currency market is entirely an OTC market. The implementation shortfall measure is the standard for measuring the total cost of the trade. IS compares a portfolio’s actual return with its paper return (where transactions are based on decision price). The IS attribution decomposes total trade cost into its delay, execution, and opportunity cost components. Delay cost is the cost associated with not submitting the order to the market at the time of the portfolio manager’s investment decision. Execution cost is the cost due to the buying and/or selling pressure of the portfolio manager and corresponding market risk. Opportunity cost is the cost due to not being able to execute all shares of the order because of adverse price movement or insufficient liquidity. Trade evaluation measures the execution quality of the trade and the performance of the trader, broker, and/or algorithm used. Various techniques measure trade cost execution using different benchmarks (pre-trade, intraday, and post-trade). Trade cost analysis enables investors to better manage trading costs and understand where trading activities can be improved through the use of appropriate trading partners and venues. Major regulators mandate that asset managers have in place a trade policy document that clearly and comprehensively articulates a firm’s trading policies and escalation procedures. The objective of a trade policy is to ensure the asset manager’s execution and order-handling procedures are in line with their fiduciary duty owed to clients for best execution. A trade policy document needs to incorporate the following key aspects: meaning of best execution, factors determining the optimal order execution approach, handling trading errors, listing of eligible brokers and execution venues, and a process to monitor execution arrangements.

Performance results can be used to assess the quality of the investment approach and suggest changes that might improve it. They are also used to communicate the results of the investment process to other stakeholders and may even be used to compensate the investment managers. Therefore, it is of vital importance that practitioners who use these analyses understand how the results are generated. By gaining an understanding of the details of how these analyses work, practitioners will develop a greater understanding of the insights that might be gathered from the analysis and will also be cognizant of the limitations of those approaches, careful not to infer more than what is explicit or logically implicit in the results. We will first consider the broad categories of performance measurement, attribution, and appraisal, differentiating between the three and explaining their interrelationships. Next, we will provide practitioners with tools to evaluate the effectiveness of those analyses as we summarize various approaches to performance evaluation. We will cover returns-based, holdings-based, and transactions-based attribution, addressing the merits and shortcomings of each approach and providing guidance on how to properly interpret attribution results. Again, by reviewing how each approach generates its results, we reveal strengths and weaknesses of the individual attribution approaches. Next, we will turn to the subject of benchmarks and performance appraisal ratios. We will review the long-standing tests of benchmark quality and differentiate market indexes from benchmarks. We will also review different ratios used in performance appraisal, considering the benefits and limitations of each approach. Lastly, we will provide advice on using these tools to collectively evaluate the skill of investment managers. This advice relies heavily on understanding the analysis tools, the limitations of the approaches, the importance of data to the quality of the analysis, and the pitfalls to avoid when making recommendations.","The member should be able to: explain the following components of portfolio evaluation and their interrelationships: performance measurement, performance attribution, and performance appraisal; describe attributes of an effective attribution process; distinguish between return attribution and risk attribution and between macro and micro return attribution; describe returns-based, holdings-based, and transactions-based performance attribution, including advantages and disadvantages of each; interpret the sources of portfolio returns using a specified attribution approach; interpret the output from fixed-income attribution analyses; discuss considerations in selecting a risk attribution approach; distinguish between investment results attributable to the asset owner versus those attributable to the investment manager; discuss uses of liability-based benchmarks; describe types of asset-based benchmarks; discuss tests of benchmark quality; describe problems that arise in benchmarking alternative investments; describe the impact of benchmark misspecification on attribution and appraisal analysis; calculate and interpret the Sortino ratio, the appraisal ratio, upside/downside capture ratios, maximum drawdown, and drawdown duration; describe limitations of appraisal measures and related metrics; evaluate the skill of an investment manager.","Performance evaluation is an essential tool for understanding the quality of the investment process. Practitioners must take care, however, to understand how performance results are generated. They need a good understanding of the performance methods used, the data inputs, and the limitations of those methods. They particularly need to be careful not to infer results beyond the capabilities of the methods or the accuracy of the data. In this reading, we have discussed the following: Performance measurement provides an overall indication of the portfolio’s performance. Performance attribution builds on performance measurement to explain how the performance was achieved. Performance appraisal leverages both returns and attribution to infer the quality of the investment process. An effective attribution process must reconcile to the total portfolio return/risk, reflect the investment decision-making process, quantify the active portfolio management decisions, and provide a complete understanding of the excess return/risk of the portfolio. Return attribution analyzes the impact of investment decisions on the returns, whereas risk attribution analyzes the risk consequences of the investment decisions. Macro attribution considers the decisions of the fund sponsor, whereas micro attribution considers the decisions of the individual portfolio manager. Returns-based attribution uses returns to identify the factors that have generated those returns. Holdings-based attribution uses the holdings over time to evaluate the decisions that contributed to the returns. Transactions-based attribution uses both holdings and transactions to fully explain the performance over the evaluation period. There are various techniques for interpreting the sources of portfolio returns using a specified attribution approach. Fixed-income attribution considers the unique factors that drive bond returns, including interest rate risk and default risk. When selecting a risk attribution approach, practitioners should consider the investment decision-making process and the type of attribution analysis. Attribution is used to calculate and interpret the contribution to portfolio return and volatility from the asset allocation and within-asset-class active/passive decisions. Liability-based benchmarks focus on the cash flows that the assets are required to generate. Asset-based benchmarks contain a collection of assets to compare against the portfolio’s assets. Valid benchmarks should be unambiguous, investable, measurable, appropriate, reflective of current investment opinions, specified in advance, and accountable. Benchmark misspecification creates subsequent incorrect performance measurement and invalidates the attribution and appraisal analyses. Alternative investments are difficult to benchmark because they are typically less liquid, have fewer available market benchmarks, and often lack transparency. Investment performance appraisal ratios—including the Sortino ratio, upside/downside capture ratios, maximum drawdown, and drawdown duration—measure investment skill. Appraisal ratios must be used with care, noting the assumptions of each ratio and affording the appropriateness to the measured investment process, risk tolerance, and investor time horizon. Although appraisal ratios help identify manager skill (as opposed to luck), they often are based on investment return data, which are often limited and subject to error. Evaluation of investment manager skill requires the use of a broad range of analysis tools, with fundamental understanding of how the tools work, how they complement each other, and their specific limitations.

Growth in ETFs has also been driven by the increased use of index-based investing. ETF investors need to understand how these products work and trade and how to choose from the numerous options available. Although many ETFs are organized under the same regulation as mutual fund products, there are important differences related to trading and tax efficiency. ETFs have features that can make them more tax efficient than traditional mutual funds, and not all ETFs are organized like mutual funds. ETFs can be based on derivative strategies, use leverage and shorting, and be offered in alternate structures, such as exchange-traded notes (ETNs), which have their own unique risks. Understanding how ETF shares are created and redeemed is key to understanding how these products can add value in a portfolio. Because so many ETFs track indexes, understanding their index tracking or tracking error is also critical. Investors should also understand how to assess an ETF’s trading costs, including differences between the ETF’s market price and the fair value of its portfolio holdings. We start with a discussion of the primary and secondary markets for ETFs, including the creation/redemption process, before moving on to important investor considerations, such as costs and risks. We then explain how ETFs are use in strategic, tactical, and portfolio efficiency applications.",The member should be able to: explain the creation/redemption process of ETFs and the function of authorized participants;<list-type>los</list-type> describe how ETFs are traded in secondary markets; describe sources of tracking error for ETFs; describe factors affecting ETF bid–ask spreads; describe sources of ETF premiums and discounts to NAV; describe costs of owning an ETF; describe types of ETF risk; identify and describe portfolio uses of ETFs.,"We have examined important considerations for ETF investors, including how ETFs work and trade, tax efficient attributes, and key portfolio uses. The following is a summary of key points: ETFs rely on a creation/redemption mechanism that allows for the continuous creation and redemption of ETF shares. The only investors who can create or redeem new ETF shares are a special group of institutional investors called authorized participants. ETFs trade on both the primary market (directly between APs and issuers) and on the secondary markets (exchange-based or OTC trades, such as listed equity). End investors trade ETFs on the secondary markets, like stocks. Holding period performance deviations (tracking differences) are more useful than the standard deviation of daily return differences (tracking error). ETF tracking differences from the index occur for the following reasons: fees and expenses, representative sampling/optimization, use of depositary receipts and other ETFs, index changes, fund accounting practices, regulatory and tax requirements, and asset manager operations. ETFs are generally taxed in the same manner as the securities they hold, with some nuances: ETFs are more tax fair than traditional mutual funds, because portfolio trading is generally not required when money enters or exits an ETF. Owing to the creation/redemption process, ETFs can be more tax efficient than mutual funds. ETF issuers can redeem out low-cost-basis securities to minimize future taxable gains. Local markets have unique ETF taxation issues that should be considered. ETF bid–ask spreads vary by trade size and are usually published for smaller trade sizes. They are tightest for ETFs that are very liquid and have continuous two-way order flow. For less liquid ETFs, the following factors can determine the quoted bid–ask spread of an ETF trade: Creation/redemption costs, brokerage and exchange fees Bid–ask spread of underlying securities held by the ETF Risk of hedging or carry positions by liquidity provider Market makers’ target profit spread ETF bid–ask spreads on fixed income relative to equity tend to be wider because the underlying bonds trade in dealer markets and hedging is more difficult. Spreads on ETFs holding international stocks are tightest when the underlying security markets are open for trading. ETF premiums and discounts refer to the difference between the exchange price of the ETF and the fund’s calculated NAV, based on the prices of the underlying securities and weighted by the portfolio positions at the start of each trading day. Premiums and discounts can occur because NAVs are based on the last traded prices, which may be observed at a time lag to the ETF price, or because the ETF is more liquid and more reflective of current information and supply and demand than the underlying securities in rapidly changing markets. Costs of ETF ownership may be positive or negative and include both explicit and implicit costs. The main components of ETF cost are the fund management fee; tracking error; portfolio turnover; trading costs, such as commissions, bid–ask spreads, and premiums/discounts; taxable gains/losses; and security lending. Trading costs are incurred when the position is entered and exited. These one-time costs decrease as a portion of total holding costs over longer holding periods and are a more significant consideration for shorter-term tactical ETF traders. Other costs, such as management fees and portfolio turnover, increase as a proportion of overall cost as the investor holding period lengthens. These costs are a more significant consideration for longer-term buy-and-hold investors. ETFs are different from exchange-traded notes, although both use the creation/redemption process. Exchange-traded notes carry unique counterparty risks of default. Swap-based ETFs may carry counterparty risk. ETFs, like mutual funds, may lend their securities, creating risk of counterparty default. ETF closures can create unexpected tax liabilities. ETFs are used for core asset class exposure, multi-asset, dynamic, and tactical strategies based on investment views or changing market conditions; for factor or smart beta strategies with a goal to improve return or modify portfolio risk; and for portfolio efficiency applications, such as rebalancing, liquidity management, completion strategies, and transitions. ETFs are useful for investing cash inflows, as well as for raising proceeds to provide for client withdrawals. ETFs are used for rebalancing to target asset class weights and for “completion strategies” to fill a temporary gap in an asset class category, sector, or investment theme or when external managers are underweight. When positions are in transition from one external manager to another, ETFs are often used as the temporary holding and may be used to fund the new manager. All types of investors use ETFs to establish low-cost core exposure to asset classes, equity style benchmarks, fixed-income categories, and commodities. For more tactical investing, thematic ETFs are used in active portfolio management and represent narrow or niche areas of the equity market not well represented by industry or sector ETFs. Systematic, active strategies that use rules-based benchmarks for exposure to such factors as size, value, momentum, quality, or dividend tilts or combinations of these factors are frequently implemented with ETFs. Multi-asset and global asset allocation or macro strategies that manage positions dynamically as market conditions change are also areas where ETFs are frequently used. Proper utilization requires investors to carefully research and assess the ETF’s index construction methodology, costs, risks, and performance history.

This yield spread or difference compensates investors for the risk that they might not receive interest and principal cash flows as expected, whether as a result of a financially distressed corporate borrower, a sovereign issuer unable (or unwilling) to meet scheduled payments, or a deterioration in credit quality in an underlying pool of assets of a structured instrument such as an asset-backed security. A portion of the yield spread reflects the bid–offer cost of buying or selling a particular bond versus a government security, a liquidity premium that varies based on market conditions. Active managers of spread-based fixed-income portfolios take positions in credit and other risk factors that vary from those of an index to generate excess return versus passive index replication. Financial analysts who build on their foundational knowledge by mastering these more advanced fixed-income concepts and tools will broaden their career opportunities in the investment industry. We begin by reviewing expected fixed-income portfolio return components with a particular focus on credit spreads. These spreads are not directly observable but rather derived from market information. Similar to benchmark yield curves, credit-spread curves are often defined by spread level and slope, and usually grouped by credit rating to gauge relative risk as well as to anticipate and act on expected changes in these relationships over the business cycle. We outline credit spread measures for fixed- and floating-rate bonds and quantify the effect of spread changes on portfolio value. Building blocks for active credit management beyond individual bonds include exchange-traded funds (ETFs), structured financial instruments, and derivative products such as credit default swaps (CDS). These tools are used to describe bottom-up and top-down active credit management approaches as well as how managers position spread-based fixed-income portfolios to capitalize on a market view.","The member should be able to: describe risk considerations for spread-based fixed-income portfolios; discuss the advantages and disadvantages of credit spread measures for spread-based fixed-income portfolios, and explain why option-adjusted spread is considered the most appropriate measure; discuss bottom-up approaches to credit strategies; discuss top-down approaches to credit strategies; discuss liquidity risk in credit markets and how liquidity risk can be managed in a credit portfolio; describe how to assess and manage tail risk in credit portfolios; discuss the use of credit default swap strategies in active fixed-income portfolio management; discuss various portfolio positioning strategies that managers can use to implement a specific credit spread view; discuss considerations in constructing and managing portfolios across international credit markets; describe the use of structured financial instruments as an alternative to corporate bonds in credit portfolios; describe key inputs, outputs, and considerations in using analytical tools to manage fixed-income portfolios.","Active spread-based, fixed-income portfolio management involves taking positions in credit and other risk factors that differ from those of an index to generate excess return. The main points of the reading are as follows: Yield spreads compensate investors for the risk that they will not receive expected interest and principal cash flows and for the bid–offer cost of buying or selling a bond under current market conditions. Two key components of a bond’s credit risk are the POD and the LGD. Credit spread changes are driven by the credit cycle, or the expansion and contraction of credit over the business cycle, which causes asset prices to change based on default and recovery expectations. High-yield issuers experience greater changes in the POD over the credit cycle than investment-grade issuers, with bond prices approaching the recovery rate for distressed debt. While fixed-rate bond yield spread measures use actual, interpolated, or zero curve–based benchmark rates to capture relative credit risk, OAS allow comparison between risky option-free bonds and bonds with embedded options. FRNs pay periodic interest based on an MRR plus a yield spread. Spread duration measures the change in a bond’s price for a given change in yield spread, while spread changes for lower-rated bonds tend to be proportional on a percentage rather than an absolute basis. Bottom-up credit strategies include the use of financial ratio analysis, reduced form credit models (such as the Z-score model), and structural credit models, including Bloomberg’s DRSK model. Top-down credit strategies are often based on macro factors and group investment choices by credit rating and industry sector categories. Fixed-income factor investing incorporates such factors as size, value, and momentum to target active returns and also increasingly include ESG factors. Liquidity risk in credit markets is higher than in equities because of market structure differences and is often addressed using liquid bonds for short-term tactical positioning, less liquid positions for buy-and-hold strategies, and liquid alternatives where active management adds little value. Credit market tail risk is usually quantified using VaR or expected shortfall measures and is frequently managed using position limits, risk budgeting, or derivative strategies. Credit derivative strategies offer a synthetic liquid alternative to active portfolio managers as a means of over- or underweighting issuers, sectors, and/or maturities across the credit spectrum. Credit spread levels and curve slopes change over the credit cycle, with credit curve steepening usually indicating low near-term default expectations and higher growth expectations, while curve flattening, or inversion, suggests rising default expectations and lower future growth. Active credit managers can benefit under a stable credit curve scenario by adding spread duration for existing exposures and/or increasing average portfolio credit risk and can capitalize on divergent market views using cash- or derivative-based strategies related to specific issuers, sectors, or the overall credit market. Investors in international credit markets distinguish between developed and emerging markets. Developed markets face common macro factors, with market and credit cycle differences affecting relative interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and credit spreads. Emerging markets usually exhibit higher growth combined with greater sovereign and geopolitical risk, currency restrictions, and capital controls. Structured financial instruments offer active credit managers access to liquid bond portfolios, fixed-income cash flows derived from real estate and consumer loans, and enhanced returns by adding volatility and/or debt exposure via tranching across the credit spectrum. Key considerations for fixed-income analytical tools include the accuracy of model inputs and assumptions as well as alignment between model outputs and fixed-income manager objectives.

Of the three, trading is often the least understood and least appreciated function. Among the questions addressed in this reading are the following: What are explicit and implicit trading costs, and how are they measured? How is a limit order book interpreted? How have trading strategies adapted to market fragmentation? What types of electronic traders can be distinguished? This reading is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the direct and indirect costs of trading. Section 3 discusses developments in electronic trading and the effects they had on transaction costs and market fragmentation. Section 4 identifies the most important types of electronic traders. Section 5 describes electronic trading facilities and some important ways traders use them. Section 6 discusses risks posed by electronic trading and how regulators control them. Finally, Section 7 summarizes the reading.","The member should be able to: explain the components of execution costs, including explicit and implicit costs; calculate and interpret effective spreads and VWAP transaction cost estimates; describe the implementation shortfall approach to transaction cost measurement; describe factors driving the development of electronic trading systems; describe market fragmentation; distinguish among types of electronic traders; describe characteristics and uses of electronic trading systems; describe comparative advantages of low-latency traders; describe the risks associated with electronic trading and how regulators mitigate them; describe abusive trading practices that real-time surveillance of markets may detect.","This reading explains the implicit and explicit costs of trading as well as widely used methods for estimating transaction costs. The reading also describes developments in electronic trading, the main types of electronic traders, their needs for speed and ways in which they trade. Electronic trading benefits investors through lower transaction costs and greater efficiencies but also introduces systemic risks and the need to closely monitor markets for abusive trading practices. Appropriate market governance and regulatory policies will help reduce the likelihood of events such as the 2010 Flash Crash. The reading’s main points include: Dealers provide liquidity to buyers and sellers when they take the other side of a trade if no other willing traders are present. The bid–ask spread is the difference between the bid and the ask prices. The effective spread is two times the difference between the trade price and the midquote price before the trade occurred. The effective spread is a poor estimate of actual transaction costs when large orders have been filled in many parts over time or when small orders receive price improvement. Transaction costs include explicit costs and implicit costs. Explicit costs are the direct costs of trading. They include broker commissions, transaction taxes, stamp duties, and exchange fees. Implicit costs include indirect costs, such as the impact of the trade on the price received. The bid–ask spread, market impact, delay, and unfilled trades all contribute to implicit trading costs. The implementation shortfall method measures the total cost of implementing an investment decision by capturing all explicit and implicit trading costs. It includes the market impact costs, delay costs, as well as opportunity costs. The VWAP method of estimating transaction costs compares average fill prices to average market prices during a period surrounding the trade. It tends to produce lower transaction cost estimates than does implementation shortfall because it often does not measure the market impact of an order well. Markets have become increasingly fragmented as venues trading the same instruments have proliferated. Trading in any given instrument now occurs in multiple venues. The advantages of electronic trading systems include cost and operational efficiencies, lack of human bias, extraordinarily fast speed, and infinite span and scope of attention. Latency is the elapsed time between the occurrence of an event and a subsequent action that depends on that event. Traders use fast communication systems and fast computer systems to minimize latency to execute their strategies faster than others. Hidden orders, quote leapfrogging, flickering quotes, and the use of machine learning to support trading strategies commonly are found in electronic markets. Traders commonly use advanced order types, trading tactics, and algorithms in electronic markets. Electronic trading has benefited investors through greater trade process efficiencies and reduced transaction costs. At the same time, electronic trading has increased systemic risks. Examples of systemic risks posed by electronic traders include: runaway algorithms that produce streams of unintended orders caused by programming mistakes, fat finger errors that occur when a manual trader submits a larger order than intended, overlarge orders that demand more liquidity than the market can provide, and malevolent order streams created deliberately to disrupt the markets. Real-time surveillance of markets often can detect order front running and various market manipulation strategies. Market manipulators use such improper activities as trading for market impact, rumormongering, wash trading, and spoofing to further their schemes. Market manipulation strategies include bluffing, squeezing, cornering, and gunning.

In that endeavor, investment portfolios—including individuals’ portfolios and institutional funds—play important roles. Asset allocation is a strategic—and often a first or early—decision in portfolio construction. Because it holds that position, it is widely accepted as important and meriting careful attention. Among the questions addressed in this reading are the following: What is a sound governance context for making asset allocation decisions? How broad a picture should an adviser have of an asset owner’s assets and liabilities in recommending an asset allocation? How can an asset owner’s objectives and sensitivities to risk be represented in asset allocation? What are the broad approaches available in developing an asset allocation recommendation, and when might one approach be more or less appropriate than another? What are the top-level decisions that need to be made in implementing a chosen asset allocation? How may asset allocations be rebalanced as asset prices change? The strategic asset allocation decision determines return levels in which allocations are invested, irrespective of the degree of active management. Because of its strategic importance, the investment committee, at the highest level of the governance hierarchy, typically retains approval of the strategic asset allocation decision. Often a proposal is developed only after a formal asset allocation study that incorporates obligations, objectives, and constraints; simulates possible investment outcomes over an agreed-on investment horizon; and evaluates the risk and return characteristics of the possible allocation strategies. In providing an overview of asset allocation, this reading’s focus is the alignment of asset allocation with the asset owner’s investment objectives, constraints, and overall financial condition. This is the first reading in several sequences of readings that address, respectively, asset allocation and portfolio management of equities, fixed income, and alternative investments. Asset allocation is also linked to other facets of portfolio management, including risk management and behavioral finance. As coverage of asset allocation progresses in the sequence of readings, various connections to these topics, covered in detail in other areas of the curriculum, will be made. In the asset allocation sequence, the role of this reading is the “big picture.” It also offers definitions that will provide a coordinated treatment of many later topics in portfolio management. The second reading provides the basic “how” of developing an asset allocation, and the third reading explores various common, real-world complexities in developing an asset allocation. This reading is organized as follows: Section 2 explains the importance of asset allocation in investment management. Section 3 addresses the investment governance context in which asset allocation decisions are made. Section 4 considers asset allocation from the comprehensive perspective offered by the asset owner’s economic balance sheet. Section 5 distinguishes three broad approaches to asset allocation and explains how they differ in investment objective and risk. In Section 6, these three approaches are discussed at a high level in relation to three cases. Section 7 provides a top-level orientation to how a chosen asset allocation may be implemented, providing a set of definitions that underlie subsequent readings. Section 8 discusses rebalancing considerations, and Section 9 provides a summary of the reading.","The member should be able to: describe elements of effective investment governance and investment governance considerations in asset allocation; prepare an economic balance sheet for a client and interpret its implications for asset allocation; compare the investment objectives of asset-only, liability-relative, and goals-based asset allocation approaches; contrast concepts of risk relevant to asset-only, liability-relative, and goals-based asset allocation approaches; explain how asset classes are used to represent exposures to systematic risk and discuss criteria for asset class specification; explain the use of risk factors in asset allocation and their relation to traditional asset class–based approaches; select and justify an asset allocation based on an investor’s objectives and constraints; describe the use of the global market portfolio as a baseline portfolio in asset allocation; discuss strategic implementation choices in asset allocation, including passive/active choices and vehicles for implementing passive and active mandates; discuss strategic considerations in rebalancing asset allocations.","This reading has introduced the subject of asset allocation. Among the points made are the following: Effective investment governance ensures that decisions are made by individuals or groups with the necessary skills and capacity and involves articulating the long- and short-term objectives of the investment program; effectively allocating decision rights and responsibilities among the functional units in the governance hierarchy; taking account of their knowledge, capacity, time, and position on the governance hierarchy; specifying processes for developing and approving the investment policy statement, which will govern the day-to-day operation of the investment program; specifying processes for developing and approving the program’s strategic asset allocation; establishing a reporting framework to monitor the program’s progress toward the agreed-on goals and objectives; and periodically undertaking a governance audit. The economic balance sheet includes non-financial assets and liabilities that can be relevant for choosing the best asset allocation for an investor’s financial portfolio. The investment objectives of asset-only asset allocation approaches focus on the asset side of the economic balance sheet; approaches with a liability-relative orientation focus on funding liabilities; and goals-based approaches focus on achieving financial goals. The risk concepts relevant to asset-only asset allocation approaches focus on asset risk; those of liability-relative asset allocation focus on risk in relation to paying liabilities; and a goals-based approach focuses on the probabilities of not achieving financial goals. Asset classes are the traditional units of analysis in asset allocation and reflect systematic risks with varying degrees of overlap. Assets within an asset class should be relatively homogeneous; asset classes should be mutually exclusive; asset classes should be diversifying; asset classes as a group should make up a preponderance of the world’s investable wealth; asset classes selected for investment should have the capacity to absorb a meaningful proportion of an investor’s portfolio. Risk factors are associated with non-diversifiable (i.e., systematic) risk and are associated with an expected return premium. The price of an asset and/or asset class may reflect more than one risk factor, and complicated spread positions may be necessary to identify and isolate particular risk factors. Their use as units of analysis in asset allocation is driven by considerations of controlling systematic risk exposures. The global market portfolio represents a highly diversified asset allocation that can serve as a baseline asset allocation in an asset-only approach. There are two dimensions of passive/active choices. One dimension relates to the management of the strategic asset allocation itself—for example, whether to deviate from it tactically or not. The second dimension relates to passive and active implementation choices in investing the allocation to a given asset class. Tactical and dynamic asset allocation relate to the first dimension; active and passive choices for implementing allocations to asset classes relate to the second dimension. Risk budgeting addresses the question of which types of risks to take and how much of each to take. Active risk budgeting addresses the question of how much benchmark-relative risk an investor is willing to take. At the level of the overall asset allocation, active risk can be defined relative to the strategic asset allocation benchmark. At the level of individual asset classes, active risk can be defined relative to the benchmark proxy. Rebalancing is the discipline of adjusting portfolio weights to more closely align with the strategic asset allocation. Rebalancing approaches include calendar-based and range-based rebalancing. Calendar-based rebalancing rebalances the portfolio to target weights on a periodic basis. Range-based rebalancing sets rebalancing thresholds or trigger points around target weights. The ranges may be fixed width, percentage based, or volatility based. Range-based rebalancing permits tighter control of the asset mix compared with calendar rebalancing. Strategic considerations in rebalancing include transaction costs, risk aversion, correlations among asset classes, volatility, and beliefs concerning momentum, taxation, and asset class liquidity.

People generally manage their affairs to be as happy and secure as their environment and resources will allow. But regardless of how carefully these affairs are managed, there is risk because the outcome, whether good or bad, is seldom predictable with complete certainty. There is risk inherent in nearly everything we do, but this reading will focus on economic and financial risk, particularly as it relates to investment management. All businesses and investors manage risk, whether consciously or not, in the choices they make. At its core, business and investing are about allocating resources and capital to chosen risks. In their decision process, within an environment of uncertainty, these organizations may take steps to avoid some risks, pursue the risks that provide the highest rewards, and measure and mitigate their exposure to these risks as necessary. Risk management processes and tools make difficult business and financial problems easier to address in an uncertain world. Risk is not just a matter of fate; it is something that organizations can actively manage with their decisions, within a risk management framework. Risk is an integral part of the business or investment process. Even in the earliest models of modern portfolio theory, such as mean–variance portfolio optimization and the capital asset pricing model, investment return is linked directly to risk but requires that risk be managed optimally. Proper identification and measurement of risk, and keeping risks aligned with the goals of the enterprise, are key factors in managing businesses and investments. Good risk management results in a higher chance of a preferred outcome—more value for the company or portfolio or more utility for the individual. Portfolio managers need to be familiar with risk management not only to improve the portfolio’s risk–return outcome, but also because of two other ways in which they use risk management at an enterprise level. First, they help to manage their own companies that have their own enterprise risk issues. Second, many portfolio assets are claims on companies that have risks. Portfolio managers need to evaluate the companies’ risks and how those companies are addressing them. This reading takes a broad approach that addresses both the risk management of enterprises in general and portfolio risk management. The principles underlying portfolio risk management are generally applicable to the risk management of financial and non-financial institutions as well. The concept of risk management is also relevant to individuals. Although many large organizations formally practice risk management, most individuals practice it more informally and some practice it haphazardly, oftentimes responding to risk events after they occur. Although many individuals do take reasonable precautions against unwanted risks, these precautions are often against obvious risks. The more subtle risks are often ignored. Unfortunately, many individuals do not view risk management as a formal, systematic process that would help them achieve not only their financial goals but also the ultimate goal, or maximum utility as economists like to call it, but they should. Although the primary focus of this reading is on institutions, we will also cover risk management as it applies to individuals. We will show that many common themes underlie risk management—themes that are applicable to both organizations and individuals. Although often viewed as defensive, risk management is a valuable offensive weapon in the manager’s arsenal. In the quest for preferred outcomes, such as higher profit, returns, or share price, management does not usually get to choose the outcomes but does choose the risks it takes in pursuit of those outcomes. The choice of which risks to undertake through the allocation of its scarce resources is the key tool available to management. An organization with a comprehensive risk management culture in place, in which risk is integral to every key strategy and decision, should perform better in the long-term, in good times and bad, as a result of better decision making. The fact that all businesses and investors engage in risky activities (i.e., activities with uncertain outcomes) raises a number of important questions. The questions that this reading will address include the following: What is risk management, and why is it important? What risks does an organization (or individual) face in pursuing its objectives? How are an organization’s goals affected by risk, and how does it make risk management decisions to produce better results? How does risk governance guide the risk management process and risk budgeting to integrate an organization’s goals with its activities? How does an organization measure and evaluate the risks it faces, and what tools does it have to address these risks? The answers to these questions collectively help to define the process of risk management. This reading is organized along the lines of these questions. Section 2 describes the risk management process, and Section 3 discusses risk governance and risk tolerance. Section 4 covers the identification of various risks, and Section 5 addresses the measurement and management of risks. Section 6 provides a summary.",The member should be able to: define risk management; describe features of a risk management framework; define risk governance and describe elements of effective risk governance; explain how risk tolerance affects risk management; describe risk budgeting and its role in risk governance; identify financial and non-financial sources of risk and describe how they may interact; describe methods for measuring and modifying risk exposures and factors to consider in choosing among the methods.,"Success in business and investing requires the skillful selection and management of risks. A well-developed risk management process ties together an organization’s goals, strategic competencies, and tools to create value to help it both thrive and survive. Good risk management results in better decision making and a keener assessment of the many important trade-offs in business and investing, helping managers maximize value. Risk and risk management are critical to good business and investing. Risk management is not only about avoiding risk. Taking risk is an active choice by boards and management, investment managers, and individuals. Risks must be understood and carefully chosen and managed. Risk exposure is the extent to which an organization’s value may be affected through sensitivity to underlying risks. Risk management is a process that defines risk tolerance and measures, monitors, and modifies risks to be in line with that tolerance. A risk management framework is the infrastructure, processes, and analytics needed to support effective risk management; it includes risk governance, risk identification and measurement, risk infrastructure, risk policies and processes, risk mitigation and management, communication, and strategic risk analysis and integration. Risk governance is the top-level foundation for risk management, including risk oversight and setting risk tolerance for the organization. Risk identification and measurement is the quantitative and qualitative assessment of all potential sources of risk and the organization’s risk exposures. Risk infrastructure comprises the resources and systems required to track and assess the organization’s risk profile. Risk policies and processes are management’s complement to risk governance at the operating level. Risk mitigation and management is the active monitoring and adjusting of risk exposures, integrating all the other factors of the risk management framework. Communication includes risk reporting and active feedback loops so that the risk process improves decision making. Strategic risk analysis and integration involves using these risk tools to rigorously sort out the factors that are and are not adding value as well as incorporating this analysis into the management decision process, with the intent of improving outcomes. Employing a risk management committee, along with a chief risk officer (CRO), are hallmarks of a strong risk governance framework. Governance and the entire risk process should take an enterprise risk management perspective to ensure that the value of the entire enterprise is maximized. Risk tolerance, a key element of good risk governance, delineates which risks are acceptable, which are unacceptable, and how much risk the overall organization can be exposed to. Risk budgeting is any means of allocating investments or assets by their risk characteristics. Financial risks are those that arise from activity in the financial markets. Non-financial risks arise from actions within an organization or from external origins, such as the environment, the community, regulators, politicians, suppliers, and customers. Financial risks consist of market risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk. Market risk arises from movements in stock prices, interest rates, exchange rates, and commodity prices. Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not pay an amount owed. Liquidity risk is the risk that, as a result of degradation in market conditions or the lack of market participants, one will be unable to sell an asset without lowering the price to less than the fundamental value. Non-financial risks consist of a variety of risks, including settlement risk, legal risk, regulatory risk, accounting risk, tax risk, model risk, tail risk, and operational risk. Operational risk is the risk that arises either from within the operations of an organization or from external events that are beyond the control of the organization but affect its operations. Operational risk can be caused by employees, the weather and natural disasters, vulnerabilities of IT systems, or terrorism. Solvency risk is the risk that the organization does not survive or succeed because it runs out of cash to meet its financial obligations. Individuals face many of the same organizational risks outlined here but also face health risk, mortality or longevity risk, and property and casualty risk. Risks are not necessarily independent because many risks arise as a result of other risks; risk interactions can be extremely non-linear and harmful. Risk drivers are the fundamental global and domestic macroeconomic and industry factors that create risk. Common measures of risk include standard deviation or volatility; asset-specific measures, such as beta or duration; derivative measures, such as delta, gamma, vega, and rho; and tail measures such as value at risk, CVaR and expected loss given default. Risk can be modified by prevention and avoidance, risk transfer (insurance), or risk shifting (derivatives). Risk can be mitigated internally through self-insurance or diversification. The primary determinants of which method is best for modifying risk are the benefits weighed against the costs, with consideration for the overall final risk profile and adherence to risk governance objectives.

This reading builds on the “Introduction to Asset Allocation” reading and focuses on several of the primary frameworks for developing an asset allocation, including asset-only mean–variance optimization, various liability-relative asset allocation techniques, and goals-based investing. Additionally, it touches on various other asset allocation techniques used by practitioners, as well as important related topics, such as rebalancing. The process of creating a diversified, multi-asset class portfolio typically involves two separate steps. The first step is the asset allocation decision, which can refer to both the process and the result of determining long-term (strategic) exposures to the available asset classes (or risk factors) that make up the investor’s opportunity set. Asset allocation is the first and primary step in translating the client’s circumstances, objectives, and constraints into an appropriate portfolio (or, for some approaches, multiple portfolios) for achieving the client’s goals within the client’s tolerance for risk. The second step in creating a diversified, multi-asset-class portfolio involves implementation decisions that determine the specific investments (individual securities, pooled investment vehicles, and separate accounts) that will be used to implement the targeted allocations. Although it is possible to carry out the asset allocation process and the implementation process simultaneously, in practice, these two steps are often separated for two reasons. First, the frameworks for simultaneously determining an asset allocation and its implementation are often complex. Second, in practice, many investors prefer to revisit their strategic asset allocation policy somewhat infrequently (e.g., annually or less frequently) in a dedicated asset allocation study, while most of these same investors prefer to revisit/monitor implementation vehicles (actual investments) far more frequently (e.g., monthly or quarterly). Section 2 covers the traditional mean–variance optimization (MVO) approach to asset allocation. We apply this approach in what is referred to as an “asset-only” setting, in which the goal is to create the most efficient mixes of asset classes in the absence of any liabilities. We highlight key criticisms of mean–variance optimization and methods used to address them. This section also covers risk budgeting in relation to asset allocation, factor-based asset allocation, and asset allocation with illiquid assets. The observation that almost all portfolios exist to help pay for what can be characterized as a “liability” leads to the next subject. Section 3 introduces liability-relative asset allocation—including a straightforward extension of mean–variance optimization known as surplus optimization. Surplus optimization is an economic balance sheet approach extended to the liability side of the balance sheet that finds the most efficient asset class mixes in the presence of liabilities. Liability-relative optimization is simultaneously concerned with the return of the assets, the change in value of the liabilities, and how assets and liabilities interact to determine the overall value or health of the total portfolio. Section 4 covers an increasingly popular approach to asset allocation called goals-based asset allocation. Conceptually, goals-based approaches are similar to liability-relative asset allocation in viewing risk in relation to specific needs or objectives associated with different time horizons and degrees of urgency. Section 5 introduces some informal (heuristic) ways that asset allocations have been determined and other approaches to asset allocation that emphasize specific objectives. Section 6 addresses the factors affecting choices that are made in developing specific policies relating to rebalancing to the strategic asset allocation. Factors discussed include transaction costs, correlations, volatility, and risk aversion. Section 7 summarizes important points and concludes the reading.",The member should be able to: describe and critique the use of mean–variance optimization in asset allocation; recommend and justify an asset allocation using mean–variance optimization; interpret and critique an asset allocation in relation to an investor’s economic balance sheet; discuss asset class liquidity considerations in asset allocation; explain absolute and relative risk budgets and their use in determining and implementing an asset allocation; describe how client needs and preferences regarding investment risks can be incorporated into asset allocation; discuss the use of Monte Carlo simulation and scenario analysis to evaluate the robustness of an asset allocation; describe the use of investment factors in constructing and analyzing an asset allocation; recommend and justify an asset allocation based on the global market portfolio; describe and evaluate characteristics of liabilities that are relevant to asset allocation; discuss approaches to liability-relative asset allocation; recommend and justify a liability-relative asset allocation; recommend and justify an asset allocation using a goals-based approach; describe and critique heuristic and other approaches to asset allocation; discuss factors affecting rebalancing policy.,Summary section is missing.,"['Risk Analysis & Management', 'Portfolio Optimization & Rebalancing', 'Investment Products & Asset Classes', 'Financial Markets', 'Trading Strategies', 'Return Analysis & Performance Measurement', 'Bonds', 'Real Estate', 'International Investing', 'Investment Management Strategies', 'Equity Investments', 'Alternative Assets', 'Fixed Income Investments', 'Financial Regulation', 'Hedge Strategies']",Principles of Asset Allocation,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/principles-asset-allocation

The foundation of this reading is the computation of risk and return of a portfolio and the role that correlation plays in diversifying portfolio risk and arriving at the efficient frontier. The efficient frontier and the capital allocation line consist of portfolios that are generally acceptable to all investors. By combining an investor’s individual indifference curves with the market-determined capital allocation line, we are able to illustrate that the only optimal risky portfolio for an investor is the portfolio of all risky assets (i.e., the market). Additionally, we discuss the capital market line, a special case of the capital allocation line that is used for passive investor portfolios. We also differentiate between systematic and nonsystematic risk, and explain why investors are compensated for bearing systematic risk but receive no compensation for bearing nonsystematic risk. We discuss in detail the CAPM, which is a simple model for estimating asset returns based only on the asset’s systematic risk. Finally, we illustrate how the CAPM allows security selection to build an optimal portfolio for an investor by changing the asset mix beyond a passive market portfolio. The reading is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the consequences of combining a risk-free asset with the market portfolio and provide an interpretation of the capital market line. Section 3 decomposes total risk into systematic and nonsystematic risk and discusses the characteristics of and differences between the two kinds of risk. We also introduce return-generating models, including the single-index model, and illustrate the calculation of beta. In Section 4, we introduce the capital asset pricing model and the security market line. Our focus on the CAPM does not suggest that the CAPM is the only viable asset pricing model. Although the CAPM is an excellent starting point, more advanced readings expand on these discussions and extend the analysis to other models that account for multiple explanatory factors. Section 5 covers several post-CAPM developments in theory. Section 6 covers measures for evaluating the performance of a portfolio which take account of risk. Section 7 covers some applications of the CAPM in portfolio construction. A summary and practice problems conclude the reading.","The member should be able to: describe the implications of combining a risk-free asset with a portfolio of risky assets; explain the capital allocation line (CAL) and the capital market line (CML); explain systematic and nonsystematic risk, including why an investor should not expect to receive additional return for bearing nonsystematic risk; explain return generating models (including the market model) and their uses; calculate and interpret beta; explain the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), including its assumptions, and the security market line (SML); calculate and interpret the expected return of an asset using the CAPM; describe and demonstrate applications of the CAPM and the SML; calculate and interpret the Sharpe ratio, Treynor ratio, M 2 , and Jensen’s alpha.","In this reading, we discussed the capital asset pricing model in detail and covered related topics such as the capital market line. The reading began with an interpretation of the CML, uses of the market portfolio as a passive management strategy, and leveraging of the market portfolio to obtain a higher expected return. Next, we discussed systematic and nonsystematic risk and why one should not expect to be compensated for taking on nonsystematic risk. The discussion of systematic and nonsystematic risk was followed by an introduction to beta and return-generating models. This broad topic was then broken down into a discussion of the CAPM and, more specifically, the relationship between beta and expected return. The final section included applications of the CAPM to capital budgeting, portfolio performance evaluation, and security selection. The highlights of the reading are as follows. The capital market line is a special case of the capital allocation line, where the efficient portfolio is the market portfolio. Obtaining a unique optimal risky portfolio is not possible if investors are permitted to have heterogeneous beliefs because such beliefs will result in heterogeneous asset prices. Investors can leverage their portfolios by borrowing money and investing in the market. Systematic risk is the risk that affects the entire market or economy and is not diversifiable. Nonsystematic risk is local and can be diversified away by combining assets with low correlations. Beta risk, or systematic risk, is priced and earns a return, whereas nonsystematic risk is not priced. The expected return of an asset depends on its beta risk and can be computed using the CAPM, which is given by E ( R i ) = R f + β i [ E ( R m ) – R f ]. The security market line is an implementation of the CAPM and applies to all securities, whether they are efficient or not. Expected return from the CAPM can be used for making capital budgeting decisions. Portfolios can be evaluated by several CAPM-based measures, such as the Sharpe ratio, the Treynor ratio, M 2 , and Jensen’s alpha. The SML can assist in security selection and optimal portfolio construction. By successfully understanding the content of this reading, you should feel comfortable decomposing total variance into systematic and nonsystematic variance, analyzing beta risk, using the CAPM, and evaluating portfolios and individual securities.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V6R4-technical-analysis.pdf,Financial Reporting and Analysis,2023,Level I,"Technical analysis has been used by traders, analysts, and investors for centuries and has achieved broad acceptance among regulators and the academic community—particularly with regard to its behavioral finance aspects. This reading gives a brief overview of the field, compares technical analysis with other schools of analysis, and describes some of the main tools used in technical analysis. Although technical analysis follows predefined rules and principles, the interpretation of results is generally subjective. That is, although certain aspects, such as the calculation of indicators, follow specific rules, the interpretation of findings is often based on a melding of techniques that suit the style and approach of the individual analyst. In this respect, technical analysis is similar to fundamental analysis, which has specific rules for calculating ratios, for example, but introduces increased subjectivity in the evaluation phase.","The member should be able to: explain principles and assumptions of technical analysis; describe potential links between technical analysis and behavioral finance; compare principles of technical analysis and fundamental analysis; describe and interpret different types of technical analysis charts; explain uses of trend, support, and resistance lines; explain common chart patterns; explain common technical indicators; describe principles of intermarket analysis; explain technical analysis applications to portfolio management.","Technical analysis is a form of security analysis that uses price data and volume data, typically displayed graphically in charts. The charts are analyzed using various indicators in order to make investment recommendations. Technical analysis has three main principles and assumptions: (1) The market discounts everything, (2) prices move in trends and countertrends, and (3) price action is repetitive, with certain patterns reoccurring. Increasingly, analysts, fund managers, and individual investors are studying the basic principles of technical analysis to support their decision making in financial markets. Behavioral finance, which is the study of the influence of psychology on the behavior of investors, focuses on the fact that investors are not always rational, have limits to their self-control, and are influenced by their own biases. This relatively new field of finance is motivating more practitioners to consider technical analysis as a tool for understanding and explaining irrationalities in financial markets. Technical analysis can be used on any freely traded security in the global market and is used on a wide range of financial instruments, such as equities, bonds, commodities, currencies, and futures. However, in general, technical analysis is most effectively applied to liquid markets. Therefore, technical analysis has limited usefulness for illiquid securities, where a small trade can have a large impact on prices. The primary tools used in technical analysis are charts and indicators. Charts are graphical displays of price and volume data. Indicators are approaches to analyzing the charts. While the tools can be used on a standalone basis, many analysts, fund managers, and investors will find added value in combining the techniques of chart analysis with their own research and investment approach. Charts provide information about past price behavior and provide a basis for inferences about likely future price behavior. Basic charts include line charts, bar charts, and candlestick charts. Charts can be drawn either to a linear scale or to a logarithmic scale. A logarithmic scale is appropriate when the data move through a range of values representing several orders of magnitude (e.g., from 10 to 10,000), whereas a linear scale is better suited to narrower ranges (e.g., $35 to $50). Volume is an important element of technical analysis and is often included on charts. Volume can be viewed as a confirmation in that it indicates the strength or conviction of buyers and sellers in determining a security’s price. One of the most important steps in successfully applying technical analysis is to define the time period being analyzed. Technical analysis and charting become more reliable as the time scale increases from intraday to daily, weekly, and even monthly. Analysts and investors whose primary research method is fundamental analysis will find more value in charting instruments on a weekly and/or a monthly scale. Longer time frames will allow analysts and investors to better identify the consolidation and trend periods and time their purchases or sales of securities. Several basic concepts can be applied to charts. These include relative strength analysis, trend, consolidation, support, resistance, and change in polarity. Relative strength analysis is based on the ratio of the prices of a security and a benchmark and is used to compare the performance of one asset with the performance of another asset. The concept of trend is an important aspect of technical analysis. An uptrend is defined as a sequence of higher highs and higher lows. To draw an uptrend line, a technician draws a line connecting the lows on the price chart. A downtrend is defined as a sequence of lower highs and lower lows. To draw a downtrend line, a technician draws a line connecting the highs on the price chart. Support is defined as a low price range in which the price stops declining because of buying activity. It is the opposite of resistance, which is a price range in which price stops rising because of selling activity. Chart patterns are formations appearing on price charts that create some type of recognizable shape. There are two major types of chart patterns: reversal patterns and continuation patterns. Reversal patterns signal the end of a trend. Common reversal patterns are head and shoulders (H&S), inverse H&S, double top, double bottom, triple top, and triple bottom. Continuation patterns indicate that a market trend that was in place prior to the pattern formation will continue once the pattern is completed. Common continuation patterns are triangles (symmetrical, ascending, and descending), rectangles (bullish and bearish), flags, and pennants. Technical indicators are used to derive additional information from basic chart patterns. An indicator is any measure based on price, market sentiment, or fund flows that can be used to predict changes in price. Mathematically calculated indicators usually have a supply and demand underpinning. Basic types of indicators include price-based indicators, momentum oscillators, and sentiment indicators. Price-based indicators incorporate information contained in market prices. Common price-based indicators include the moving average and Bollinger Bands. The moving average is the average of the closing prices of a security over a specified number of periods. Moving averages are a smoothing technique that gives the technical analyst a view of market trends. So, a moving average can be viewed as a trend filter. Long-term moving averages can provide important signals. A price move above the long-term moving average is a sign of an uptrend. A price move below the long-term moving average is a sign of a downtrend. When a short-term moving average crosses over a longer-term moving average from underneath, this movement is considered a bullish indicator and is called a “bullish crossover.” When a short-term moving-average crosses over a longer-term moving average from above, this movement is a bearish indicator and is called a “bearish crossover.” Bollinger Bands combine the concept of a moving average with standard deviations around the moving average. This tool is useful in defining a trading range for the security being analyzed. The Bollinger Band width indicator provides an indication of volatility. The idea is that periods of low volatility are followed by periods of high volatility, so that relatively narrow band width can foreshadow an advance or decline in the security under analysis. Momentum oscillators are constructed from price data, but they are calculated so that they fluctuate between a low and a high, typically between 0 and 100. Some examples of momentum oscillators include rate of change (ROC) oscillators, the relative strength index (RSI), stochastic oscillators, and the MACD (moving-average convergence/divergence oscillator). Momentum oscillators can be viewed as graphical representations of market sentiment that show when selling or buying activity is more aggressive than usual. Technical analysts also look for convergence or divergence between oscillators and price. For example, when the price reaches a new high, this outcome is usually considered “bullish.” But if the momentum oscillator does not also reach a new high, this scenario is considered divergence and an early warning sign of weakness. Momentum oscillators also alert the technical analyst to overbought or oversold conditions. For example, in an oversold condition, market sentiment is considered unsustainably bearish. Sentiment indicators attempt to gauge investor activity for signs of increasing bullishness or bearishness. Commonly used calculated statistical indexes are the put/call ratio, the VIX, and margin debt. Intermarket analysis combines technical analysis of the major categories of securities—namely, equities, bonds, currencies, and commodities—to identify market trends and possible inflections in trends. Intermarket analysis also looks at industry subsectors and their relationship to sectors and industries. In addition, it measures the relative performance of major equity benchmarks around the globe. Technical analysis can use either a top-down approach or a bottom-up approach to analyze securities. The top-down method is useful for identifying outperforming asset classes, countries, or sectors. This approach can add value to asset allocation decisions. Allocation shifts can occur within an asset class or across asset classes. The bottom-up method is useful for identifying individual stocks, commodities, or currencies that are outperforming, irrespective of market, industry, or macro trends. The technical analyst can add value to an investment team by providing trading/ investment ideas through either top-down or bottom-up analysis, depending on the nature of the investment firm or fund. In addition, technical analysis can add value to a fundamental portfolio approach by providing input on the timing of the purchase or sale of a security.

Financial markets are the forums where savers are connected with investors. This activity enables savers to defer consumption today for consumption in the future, allows governments to raise the capital necessary to create a secure society, and permits corporations to access capital to exploit profitable investment opportunities, which, in turn, should help to generate future economic growth and employment. Furthermore, all financial instruments essentially represent claims on an underlying economy. There is, therefore, an important and fundamental connection that runs from the decisions of economic agents, as they plan their present and future consumption, to the prices of financial instruments, such as bonds and equities. The purpose of this reading is to identify and explain the links between the real economy and financial markets and to show how economic analysis can be used to develop ways of valuing both individual financial market securities and aggregations of these securities, such as financial market indexes. We begin by reviewing what we refer to as the fundamental pricing equation for all financial instruments. Using this framework, we then move on to explore the relationship between the economy and real default-free debt. From there, we can extend the analysis to the ways in which the economy can influence the prices of the following: nominal default-free debt; credit risky debt (for example, corporate bonds); publicly traded equities; and commercial real estate.","The member should be able to: explain the notion that to affect market values, economic factors must affect one or more of the following: 1) default-free interest rates across maturities, 2) the timing and/or magnitude of expected cash flows, and 3) risk premiums; explain the role of expectations and changes in expectations in market valuation; explain the relationship between the long-term growth rate of the economy, the volatility of the growth rate, and the average level of real short-term interest rates; explain how the phase of the business cycle affects policy and short-term interest rates, the slope of the term structure of interest rates, and the relative performance of bonds of differing maturities; describe the factors that affect yield spreads between non-inflation-adjusted and inflation-indexed bonds; explain how the phase of the business cycle affects credit spreads and the performance of credit-sensitive fixed-income instruments; explain how the characteristics of the markets for a company’s products affect the company’s credit quality; explain how the phase of the business cycle affects short-term and long-term earnings growth expectations; explain the relationship between the consumption hedging properties of equity and the equity risk premium; describe cyclical effects on valuation multiples; describe how economic analysis is used in sector rotation strategies; describe the economic factors affecting investment in commercial real estate.","In this reading, we have sought to explain the fundamental connection between the prices of financial assets and the underlying economy. The connection should be strong because ultimately all financial assets represent a claim on the real economy. Because all financial assets offer a means of deferring consumption, to make the connection tangible we have explored the relationship between these asset prices and the consumption and saving decisions of economic agents. At any point in time, the market value of any financial security is simply the sum of discounted values of the cash flows that the security is expected to produce. The timing and magnitude of these expected cash flows will thus be an integral part of the security’s market value, as will the discount rate applied to these expected cash flows, which is the sum of a real default-free interest rate, expected inflation, and possibly several risk premiums. Each of these elements will be influenced by the business cycle. It is through these components that the real economy exerts its influence on the market value of financial instruments. The average level of real short-term interest rates is positively related to the trend rate of growth of the underlying economy and also to the volatility of economic growth in the economy. Other things being equal, these relationships mean that we should expect to find that the average level of real short-term interest rates is higher in an economy with high and volatile growth and lower in an economy with lower, more stable growth. On average, over time, according to the Taylor rule, a central bank’s policy rate should comprise the sum of an economy’s trend growth plus inflation expectations, which might, in turn, be anchored to an explicit inflation target. This policy rate level is referred to as the neutral rate. Other things being equal, when inflation is above (below) the targeted level, the policy rate should be above (below) the neutral rate, and when the output gap is positive (negative), the policy rate should also be above (below) the neutral rate. The policy rate can thus vary over time with inflation expectations and the economy’s output gap. Short-term nominal rates will be closely related to a central bank’s policy rate of interest and will comprise the real interest rate that is required to balance the requirements of savers and investors plus investors’ expectations of inflation over the relevant borrowing or lending period. Short-term nominal interest rates will be positively related to short-term real interest rates and to inflation expectations. If bond investors were risk neutral, then the term structure of interest rates would be determined by short-term interest rate expectations. But bond investors are risk averse, which means that they will normally demand a risk premium for investing in even default-free government bonds. This risk premium will generally rise with the maturity of these bonds because longer-dated government bonds tend to be less negatively correlated with consumption and, therefore, represent a less useful consumption hedge for investors. Overall, the shape of the curve will be determined by a combination of short-term interest rates and inflation expectations as well as risk premiums. In turn, these factors will be influenced by the business cycle and policymakers. The yield differential between default-free conventional government bonds and index-linked equivalents will be driven by inflation expectations and a risk premium. The risk premium will be largely influenced by investors’ uncertainty about future inflation. The difference between the yield on a corporate bond and that on a government bond with the same currency denomination and maturity is referred to as the measured credit spread. It is conceptually akin (but not equal) to the risk premium demanded by investors in compensation for the additional credit risk that they bear compared with that embodied in the default-free government bond. It tends to rise in times of economic weakness, as the probability of default rises, and tends to narrow in times of robust economic growth, when defaults are less common. The uncertainty about and time variation in future equity cash flows (dividends) is a distinct feature of equity investment, as opposed to corporate bond investment. This feature explains why we would expect the equity premium to be larger than the credit premium. In times of economic weakness or stress, the uncertainty about future dividends will tend to be higher, and we should thus expect the equity risk premium to rise in such an economic environment. Given the uncertain nature of the cash flows generated by equities, investors will demand an equity risk premium because the consumption hedging properties of equities are poor. In other words, equities tend not to pay off in bad times. Because in the event of company failure an equity holder will lose all of his or her investment whereas an investor in the company’s bonds may recover a significant portion of his or her investment, it would be reasonable to assume that a risk-averse investor would demand a higher premium on an equity holding than on a corporate bond holding. The two premiums will tend to be positively correlated over time and will tend to be influenced by the business cycle in similar ways. The P/E tends to rise during periods of economic expansion and to fall during recessions. A “high” P/E could be the result of a number of factors, including the following: falling real interest rates, a decline in the equity risk premium, an increase in the expectation of future real earnings growth, an expectation of lower operating and/or financial risk, or a combination of all of these factors. All of these components will be influenced by the business cycle. The market value of an investment in commercial property can be derived in much the same way as the market value of an investment in equity. The cash flows come in the form of rent, which can be enhanced with additional redevelopment values as leases on properties expire. These cash flows are uncertain, and the uncertainty surrounding them will tend to rise when the economy turns down. We might thus expect the risk premium demanded on commercial property investments to rise in these times. The pro-cyclical nature of commercial property prices means that investors will generally demand a relatively high risk premium in return for investing in this asset class. The reason is that commercial property is not a very good hedge against bad economic outcomes. In addition, the illiquid nature of property investment means that investors may also demand a liquidity premium for investing in this asset class.

In this reading, we will explore the process of examining the risk and return characteristics of individual assets, creating all possible portfolios, selecting the most efficient portfolios, and ultimately choosing the optimal portfolio tailored to the individual in question. During the process of constructing the optimal portfolio, several factors and investment characteristics are considered. The most important of those factors are risk and return of the individual assets under consideration. Correlations among individual assets along with risk and return are important determinants of portfolio risk. Creating a portfolio for an investor requires an understanding of the risk profile of the investor. Although we will not discuss the process of determining risk aversion for individuals or institutional investors, it is necessary to obtain such information for making an informed decision. In this reading, we will explain the broad types of investors and how their risk–return preferences can be formalized to select the optimal portfolio from among the infinite portfolios contained in the investment opportunity set. The reading is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the investment characteristics of assets. In particular, we show the various types of returns and risks, their computation and their applicability to the selection of appropriate assets for inclusion in a portfolio. Section 3 discusses risk aversion and how indifference curves, which incorporate individual preferences, can be constructed. The indifference curves are then applied to the selection of an optimal portfolio using two risky assets. Section 4 provides an understanding and computation of portfolio risk. The role of correlation and diversification of portfolio risk are examined in detail. Section 5 begins with the risky assets available to investors and constructs a large number of risky portfolios. It illustrates the process of narrowing the choices to an efficient set of risky portfolios before identifying the optimal risky portfolio. The risky portfolio is combined with investor risk preferences to generate the investor’s optimal portfolio. A summary concludes this reading.","The member should be able to: calculate and interpret major return measures and describe their appropriate uses; compare the money-weighted and time-weighted rates of return and evaluate the performance of portfolios based on these measures; describe characteristics of the major asset classes that investors consider in forming portfolios; calculate and interpret the mean, variance, and covariance (or correlation) of asset returns based on historical data; explain risk aversion and its implications for portfolio selection; calculate and interpret portfolio standard deviation; describe the effect on a portfolio’s risk of investing in assets that are less than perfectly correlated; describe and interpret the minimum-variance and efficient frontiers of risky assets and the global minimum-variance portfolio; explain the selection of an optimal portfolio, given an investor’s utility (or risk aversion) and the capital allocation line.","This reading provides a description and computation of investment characteristics, such as risk and return, that investors use in evaluating assets for investment. This was followed by sections about portfolio construction, selection of an optimal risky portfolio, and an understanding of risk aversion and indifference curves. Finally, the tangency point of the indifference curves with the capital allocation line allows identification of the optimal investor portfolio. Key concepts covered in the reading include the following: Holding period return is most appropriate for a single, predefined holding period. Multiperiod returns can be aggregated in many ways. Each return computation has special applications for evaluating investments. Risk-averse investors make investment decisions based on the risk–return trade-off, maximizing return for the same risk, and minimizing risk for the same return. They may be concerned, however, by deviations from a normal return distribution and from assumptions of financial markets’ operational efficiency. Investors are risk averse, and historical data confirm that financial markets price assets for risk-averse investors. The risk of a two-asset portfolio is dependent on the proportions of each asset, their standard deviations and the correlation (or covariance) between the assets’ returns. As the number of assets in a portfolio increases, the correlation among asset risks becomes a more important determinate of portfolio risk. Combining assets with low correlations reduces portfolio risk. The two-fund separation theorem allows us to separate decision making into two steps. In the first step, the optimal risky portfolio and the capital allocation line are identified, which are the same for all investors. In the second step, investor risk preferences enable us to find a unique optimal investor portfolio for each investor. The addition of a risk-free asset creates portfolios that are dominant to portfolios of risky assets in all cases except for the optimal risky portfolio.

The typical applications of these derivatives involve modifying investment positions for hedging purposes or for taking directional bets, creating or replicating desired payoffs, implementing asset allocation and portfolio rebalancing decisions, and even inferring current market expectations. The following table shows some common uses of these derivatives in portfolio management and the types of derivatives used by investors and portfolio managers. Common Uses of Swaps, Forwards, and Futures Typical Derivatives Used Modifying Portfolio Returns and Risk Exposures (Hedging and Directional Bets) Interest Rate, Currency, and Equity Swaps and Futures; Fixed-Income Futures; Variance Swaps Creating Desired Payoffs Forwards, Futures, Total Return Swaps Performing Asset Allocation and Portfolio Rebalancing Equity Index Futures, Government Bond Futures, Index Swaps Inferring Market Expectations for Interest Rates, Inflation, and Volatility Fed Funds Futures, Inflation Swaps, VIX Futures It is important for an informed investment professional to understand how swaps, forwards, futures, and volatility derivatives can be used and their associated risk–return trade-offs. Therefore, the purpose of this reading is to illustrate ways in which these derivatives might be used in typical investment situations. Section 2 of this reading shows how swaps, forwards, and futures can be used to modify the risk exposure of an existing position. Section 3 provides a discussion on derivatives on volatility. Section 4 demonstrates a series of applications showing ways in which a portfolio manager might solve an investment problem with these derivatives. The reading concludes with a summary.","The member should be able to: demonstrate how interest rate swaps, forwards, and futures can be used to modify a portfolio’s risk and return; demonstrate how currency swaps, forwards, and futures can be used to modify a portfolio’s risk and return; demonstrate how equity swaps, forwards, and futures can be used to modify a portfolio’s risk and return; demonstrate the use of volatility derivatives and variance swaps; demonstrate the use of derivatives to achieve targeted equity and interest rate risk exposures; demonstrate the use of derivatives in asset allocation, rebalancing, and inferring market expectations.","This reading on swap, forward, and futures strategies shows a number of ways in which market participants might use these derivatives to enhance returns or to reduce risk to better meet portfolio objectives. Following are the key points. Interest rate, currency, and equity swaps, forwards, and futures can be used to modify risk and return by altering the characteristics of the cash flows of an investment portfolio. An interest rate swap is an OTC contract in which two parties agree to exchange cash flows on specified dates, one based on a floating interest rate and the other based on a fixed rate (swap rate), determined at swap initiation. Both rates are applied to the swap’s notional value to determine the size of the payments, which are typically netted. Interest rate swaps enable a party with a fixed (floating) risk or obligation to effectively convert it into a floating (fixed) one. Investors can use short-dated interest rate futures and forward rate agreements or longer-dated fixed-income (bond) futures contracts to modify their portfolios’ interest rate risk exposure. When hedging interest rate risk with bond futures, one must determine the basis point value of the portfolio to be hedged, the target basis point value, and the basis point value of the futures, which itself is determined by the basis point value of the cheapest-to-deliver bond and its conversion factor. The number of bond futures to buy or sell to reach the target basis point value is then determined by the basis point value hedge ratio: B P V H R = ( B P V T − B P V P B P V C T D ) × C F . Cross-currency basis swaps help parties in the swap to hedge against the risk of exchange rate fluctuations and to achieve better rate outcomes. Firms that need foreign-denominated cash can obtain funding in their local currency (likely at a more favorable rate) and then swap the local currency for the required foreign currency using a cross-currency basis swap. Equity risk in a portfolio can be managed using equity swaps and total return swaps. There are three main types of equity swap: (1) receive-equity return, pay-fixed; (2) receive-equity return, pay-floating; and (3) receive-equity return, pay-another equity return. A total return swap is a modified equity swap; it also includes in the performance any dividends paid by the underlying stocks or index during the period until the swap maturity. Equity risk in a portfolio can also be managed using equity futures and forwards. Equity futures are standardized, exchange-listed contracts, and when the underlying is a stock index, only cash settlement is available at contract expiration. The number of equity futures contracts to buy or sell is determined by N f = ( β T − β S β f ) ( S F ) . Cash equitization is a strategy designed to boost returns by finding ways to “equitize” unintended cash holdings. It is typically done using stock index futures and interest rate futures. Derivatives on volatility include VIX futures and options and variance swaps. Importantly, VIX option prices are determined from VIX futures, and both instruments allow an investor to implement a view depending on her expectations about the timing and magnitude of a change in implied volatility. In a variance swap, the buyer of the contract will pay the difference between the fixed variance strike specified in the contract and the realized variance (annualized) on the underlying over the period specified and applied to a variance notional. Thus, variance swaps allow directional bets on implied versus realized volatility. Derivatives can be used to infer market participants’ current expectations for changes over the short term in inflation (e.g., CPI swaps) and market volatility (e.g., VIX futures). Another common application is using fed funds futures prices to derive the probability of a central bank move in the federal funds rate target at the FOMC’s next meeting.

Rationales for investing in equities include potential participation in the growth and earnings prospects of an economy’s corporate sector as well as an ownership interest in a range of business entities by size, economic activity, and geographical scope. Publicly traded equities are generally more liquid than other asset classes and thus may enable investors to more easily monitor price trends and purchase or sell securities with low transaction costs. This reading provides an overview of equity portfolio management. Section 2 discusses the roles of equities in a portfolio. Section 3 discusses the equity investment universe, including several ways the universe can be segmented. Section 4 covers the income and costs in an equity portfolio. Section 5 discusses shareholder engagement between equity investors and the companies in which they invest. Section 6 discusses equity investment across the passive–active investment spectrum. A summary of key points completes the reading.",The member should be able to: describe the roles of equities in the overall portfolio; describe how an equity manager’s investment universe can be segmented; describe the types of income and costs associated with owning and managing an equity portfolio and their potential effects on portfolio performance; describe the potential benefits of shareholder engagement and the role an equity manager might play in shareholder engagement; describe rationales for equity investment across the passive–active spectrum.,"This reading provides an overview of the roles equity investments may play in the client’s portfolio, how asset owners and investment managers segment the equity universe for purposes of defining an investment mandate, the costs and obligations of equity ownership (including shareholder engagement) and issues relevant to the decision to pursue active or passive management of an equity portfolio. Among the key points made in this reading are the following: Equities can provide several roles or benefits to an overall portfolio, including capital appreciation, dividend income, diversification with other asset classes, and a potential hedge against inflation. The inclusion of equities in a portfolio can be driven by a client’s goals or needs. Portfolio managers often consider the following investment objectives and constraints when deciding to include equities (or asset classes in general, for that matter) in a client’s portfolio: risk objective; return objective; liquidity requirement; time horizon; tax concerns; legal and regulatory factors ; and unique circumstances. Investors often segment the equity universe according to (1) size and style; (2) geography; and (3) economic activity. Sources of equity portfolio income include dividends; securities lending fees and interest; dividend capture; covered calls; and cash-covered puts (or cash-secured puts). Sources of equity portfolio costs include management fees; performance fees; administration fees; marketing/distribution fees; and trading costs. Shareholder engagement is the process whereby companies engage with their shareholders. The process typically includes voting on corporate matters at general meetings and other forms of communication, such as quarterly investor calls or in-person meetings. Shareholder engagement can provide benefits for both shareholders and companies. From a company’s perspective, shareholder engagement can assist in developing a more effective corporate governance culture. In turn, shareholder engagement may lead to better company performance to the benefit of shareholders (as well as other stakeholders). Disadvantages of shareholder engagement include costs and time involved, pressure on a company to meet near-term share price or earnings targets, possible selective disclosure of information, and potential conflicts of interest. Activist investors (or activists) specialize in taking stakes in companies and creating change to generate a gain on the investment. The participation of shareholders in general meetings, also known as general assemblies, and the exercise of their voting rights are among the most influential tools available for shareholder engagement. The choice of using active management or passive management is not an “either/or” (binary) alternative but rather a decision involving a passive–active spectrum. Investors may decide to position their portfolios across the passive–active spectrum based on their confidence to outperform, client preference, suitable benchmarks, client-specific mandates, risks/costs of active management, and taxes.

New investment products, deregulation, worldwide financial system integration, and better communication and information networks have opened new global investment opportunities. At the same time, investors have increasingly shed their “home bias” and sought investment alternatives beyond their own borders. The benefits of this trend for portfolio managers have been clear, both in terms of the broader availability of higher-expected-return investments as well as portfolio diversification opportunities. Nonetheless, investments denominated in foreign currencies also bring a unique set of challenges: measuring and managing foreign exchange risk. Buying foreign-currency denominated assets means bringing currency risk into the portfolio. Exchange rates are volatile and, at least in the short to medium term, can have a marked impact on investment returns and risks— currency matters . The key to the superior performance of global portfolios is the effective management of this currency risk. This reading explores basic concepts and tools of currency management. Section 2 reviews some of the basic concepts of foreign exchange (FX) markets. The material in subsequent sections presumes an understanding of these concepts. Section 3 examines some of the basic mathematics involved in measuring the effects of foreign-currency investments on portfolio return and risk. Section 4 discusses the strategic decisions portfolio managers face in setting the target currency exposures of the portfolio. The currency exposures that the portfolio can accept range from a fully hedged position to active management of currency risk. Section 5 discusses some of the tactical considerations involving active currency management if the investment policy statement (IPS) extends some latitude for active currency management. A requisite to any active currency management is having a market view; so this section includes various methodologies by which a manager can form directional views on future exchange rate movements and volatility. Section 6 covers a variety of trading tools available to implement both hedging and active currency management strategies. Although the generic types of FX derivatives tools are relatively limited—spot, forward, option, and swap contracts—the number of variations within each and the number of combinations in which they can be used is vast. Section 7 examines some of the issues involved in managing the currency exposures of emerging market currencies—that is, those that are less liquid than the major currencies. Section 8 presents a summary.","The member should be able to: analyze the effects of currency movements on portfolio risk and return; discuss strategic choices in currency management; formulate an appropriate currency management program given financial market conditions and portfolio objectives and constraints; compare active currency trading strategies based on economic fundamentals, technical analysis, carry-trade, and volatility trading; describe how changes in factors underlying active trading strategies affect tactical trading decisions; describe how forward contracts and FX (foreign exchange) swaps are used to adjust hedge ratios; describe trading strategies used to reduce hedging costs and modify the risk–return characteristics of a foreign-currency portfolio; describe the use of cross-hedges, macro-hedges, and minimum-variance-hedge ratios in portfolios exposed to multiple foreign currencies; discuss challenges for managing emerging market currency exposures.","In this reading, we have examined the basic principles of managing foreign exchange risk within the broader investment process. International financial markets create a wide range of opportunities for investors, but they also create the need to recognize, measure, and control exchange rate risk. The management of this risk starts with setting the overall mandate for the portfolio, encoding the investors’ investment objectives and constraints into the investment policy statement and providing strategic guidance on how currency risk will be managed in the portfolio. It extends to tactical positioning when portfolio managers translate market views into specific trading strategies within the overall risk management guidelines set by the IPS. We have examined some of these trading strategies, and how a range of portfolio management tools—positions in spot, forward, option, and FX swap contracts—can be used either to hedge away currency risk, or to express a market opinion on future exchange rate movements. What we have emphasized throughout this reading is that there is no simple or single answer for the “best” currency management strategies. Different investors will have different strategic mandates (IPS), and different portfolio managers will have different market opinions and risk tolerances. There is a near-infinite number of possible currency trading strategies, each with its own benefits, costs, and risks. Currency risk management—both at the strategic and tactical levels—means having to manage the trade-offs between all of these various considerations. Some of the main points covered in this reading are as follows: In professional FX markets, currencies are identified by standard three-letter codes, and quoted in terms of a price and a base currency (P/B). The spot exchange rate is typically for T + 2 delivery, and forward rates are for delivery for later periods. Both spot and forward rates are quoted in terms of a bid–offer price. Forward rates are quoted in terms of the spot rate plus forward points. An FX swap is a simultaneous spot and forward transaction; one leg of the swap is buying the base currency and the other is selling it. FX swaps are used to renew outstanding forward contracts once they mature, to “roll them forward.” The domestic-currency return on foreign-currency assets can be broken into the foreign-currency asset return and the return on the foreign currency (the percentage appreciation or depreciation of the foreign currency against the domestic currency). These two components of the domestic-currency return are multiplicative. When there are several foreign-currency assets, the portfolio domestic-currency return is the weighted average of the individual domestic-currency returns (i.e., using the portfolio weights, which should sum to one) The risk of domestic-currency returns (its standard deviation) can be approximated by using a variance formula that recognizes the individual variances and covariances (correlations) among the foreign-currency asset returns and exchange rate movements. The calculation of the domestic-currency risk involves a large number of variables that must be estimated: the risks and correlations between all of the foreign-currency asset returns and their exchange rate risks. Guidance on where to target the portfolio along the risk spectrum is part of the IPS, which makes this a strategic decision based on the investment goals and constraints of the beneficial owners of the portfolio. If the IPS allows currency risk in the portfolio, the amount of desired currency exposure will depend on both portfolio diversification considerations and cost considerations. Views on the diversifying effects of foreign-currency exposures depend on the time horizon involved, the type of foreign-currency asset, and market conditions. Cost considerations also affect the hedging decision. Hedging is not free: It has both direct transactional costs as well as opportunity costs (the potential for favorable outcomes is foregone). Cost considerations make a perfect hedge difficult to maintain. Currency management strategies can be located along a spectrum stretching from: passive, rules-based, complete hedging of currency exposures; discretionary hedging, which allows the portfolio manager some latitude on managing currency exposures; active currency management, which seeks out currency risk in order to manage it for profit; and to currency overlay programs that aggressively manage currency “alpha.” There are a variety of methods for forming market views. The use of macroeconomic fundamentals to predict future currency movements is based on estimating the “fair value” for a currency with the expectation that spot rates will eventually converge on this equilibrium value. Technical market indicators assume that, based on market psychology, historical price patterns in the data have a tendency to repeat. Technical indicators can be used to predict support and resistance levels in the market, as well as to confirm market trends and turning points. The carry trade is based on violations of uncovered interest rate parity, and is also based on selling low-yield currencies in order to invest in high-yield currencies. This approach is equivalent to trading the forward rate bias, which means selling currencies trading at a forward premium and buying currencies trading at a forward discount. Volatility trading uses the option market to express views on the distribution of future exchange rates, not their levels. Passive hedging will typically use forward contracts (rather than futures contracts) because they are more flexible. However, currency futures contracts are an option for smaller trading sizes and are frequently used in private wealth management. Forward contracts have the possibility of negative roll yield (the forward points embedded in the forward price can work for or against the hedge). The portfolio manager will have to balance the advantages and costs of hedging with forward contracts. Foreign-currency options can reduce opportunity costs (they allow the upside potential for favorable foreign-currency movements). However, the upfront option premiums must be paid. There are a variety of means to reduce the cost of the hedging with either forward or option contracts, but these cost-reduction measures always involve some combination of less downside protection and/or less upside potential. Hedging multiple foreign currencies uses the same tools and strategies used in hedging a single foreign-currency exposure; except now the correlation between residual currency exposures in the portfolio should be considered. Cross hedges introduce basis risk into the portfolio, which is the risk that the correlation between exposure and its cross hedging instrument may change in unexpected ways. Forward contracts typically have very little basis risk compared with movements in the underlying spot rate. The number of trading strategies that can be used, for hedging or speculative purposes, either for a single foreign currency or multiple foreign currencies, is near infinite. The manager must assess the costs, benefits, and risks of each in the context of the investment goals and constraints of the portfolio. There is no single “correct” approach.

A derivative’s value is thus derived from the economic performance of the underlying. Derivatives may be created directly by counterparties or may be facilitated through established, regulated market exchanges. Direct creation between counterparties has the benefit of tailoring to the counterparties’ specific needs but also the disadvantage of potentially low liquidity. Exchange-traded derivatives often do not match counterparties’ specific needs but do facilitate early termination of the position, and, importantly, mitigate counterparty risk. Derivatives facilitate the exchange of economic risks and benefits where trades in the underlying securities might be less advantageous because of poor liquidity, transaction costs, regulatory impediments, tax or accounting considerations, or other factors. Options are an important type of contingent-claim derivative that provide their owner with the right but not an obligation to a payoff determined by the future price of the underlying asset. Unlike other types of derivatives (i.e., swaps, forwards, and futures), options have nonlinear payoffs that enable their owners to benefit from movements in the underlying in one direction without being hurt by movements in the opposite direction. The cost of this opportunity, however, is the upfront cash payment required to enter the options position. Options can be combined with the underlying and with other options in a variety of different ways to modify investment positions, to implement investment strategies, or even to infer market expectations. Therefore, investment managers routinely use option strategies for hedging risk exposures, for seeking to profit from anticipated market moves, and for implementing desired risk exposures in a cost-effective manner. The main purpose of this reading is to illustrate how options strategies are used in typical investment situations and to show the risk–return trade-offs associated with their use. Importantly, an informed investment professional should have such a basic understanding of options strategies to competently serve his investment clients. Section 2 of this reading shows how certain combinations of securities (i.e., options, underlying) are equivalent to others. Section 3 discusses two of the most widely used options strategies, covered calls and protective puts. In Section 4, we look at popular spread and combination option strategies used by investors. The focus of Section 5 is implied volatility embedded in option prices and related volatility skew and surface. Section 6 discusses option strategy selection. Section 7 demonstrates a series of applications showing ways in which an investment manager might solve an investment problem with options. The reading concludes with a summary.","The member should be able to: demonstrate how an asset’s returns may be replicated by using options; discuss the investment objective(s), structure, payoff, risk(s), value at expiration, profit, maximum profit, maximum loss, and breakeven underlying price at expiration of a covered call position; discuss the investment objective(s), structure, payoff, risk(s), value at expiration, profit, maximum profit, maximum loss, and breakeven underlying price at expiration of a protective put position; compare the delta of covered call and protective put positions with the position of being long an asset and short a forward on the underlying asset; compare the effect of buying a call on a short underlying position with the effect of selling a put on a short underlying position; discuss the investment objective(s), structure, payoffs, risk(s), value at expiration, profit, maximum profit, maximum loss, and breakeven underlying price at expiration of the following option strategies: bull spread, bear spread, straddle, and collar; describe uses of calendar spreads; discuss volatility skew and smile; identify and evaluate appropriate option strategies consistent with given investment objectives; demonstrate the use of options to achieve targeted equity risk exposures.","This reading on options strategies shows a number of ways in which market participants might use options to enhance returns or to reduce risk to better meet portfolio objectives. The following are the key points. Buying a call and writing a put on the same underlying with the same strike price and expiration creates a synthetic long position (i.e., a synthetic long forward position). Writing a call and buying a put on the same underlying with the same strike price and expiration creates a synthetic short position (i.e., a synthetic short forward position). A synthetic long put position consists of a short stock and long call position in which the call strike price equals the price at which the stock is shorted. A synthetic long call position consists of a long stock and long put position in which the put strike price equals the price at which the stock is purchased. Delta is the change in an option’s price for a change in price of the underlying, all else equal. Gamma is the change in an option’s delta for a change in price of the underlying, all else equal. Vega is the change in an option’s price for a change in volatility of the underlying, all else equal. Theta is the daily change in an option’s price, all else equal. A covered call, in which the holder of a stock writes a call giving someone the right to buy the shares, is one of the most common uses of options by individual investors. Covered calls can be used to change an investment’s risk–reward profile by effectively enhancing yield or reducing/exiting a position when the shares hit a target price. A covered call position has a limited maximum return because of the transfer of the right tail of the return distribution to the option buyer. The maximum loss of a covered call position is less than the maximum loss of the underlying shares alone, but the covered call carries the potential for an opportunity loss if the underlying shares rise sharply. A protective put is the simultaneous holding of a long stock position and a long put on the same asset. The put provides protection or insurance against a price decline. The continuous purchase of protective puts maintains the upside potential of the portfolio, while limiting downside volatility. The cost of the puts must be carefully considered, however, because this activity may be expensive. Conversely, the occasional purchase of a protective put to deal with a bearish short-term outlook can be a reasonable risk-reducing strategy. The maximum loss with a protective put is limited because the downside risk is transferred to the option writer in exchange for the payment of the option premium. With an option spread, an investor buys one option and writes another of the same type. This approach reduces the position cost but caps the maximum payoff. A bull spread expresses a bullish view on the underlying and is normally constructed by buying a call option and writing another call option with a higher exercise price (both options have same underlying and same expiry). A bear spread expresses a bearish view on the underlying and is normally constructed by buying a put option and writing another put option with a lower exercise price (both options have same underlying and same expiry). With either a bull spread or a bear spread, both the maximum gain and the maximum loss are known and limited. A long (short) straddle is an option combination in which the investor buys (sells) puts and calls with the same exercise price and expiration date. The long (short) straddle investor expects increased (stable/decreased) volatility and typically requires a large (small/no) price movement in the underlying asset in order to make a profit. A collar is an option position in which the investor is long shares of stock and simultaneously writes a call with an exercise price above the current stock price and buys a put with an exercise price below the current stock price. A collar limits the range of investment outcomes by sacrificing upside gain in exchange for providing downside protection. A long (short) calendar spread involves buying (selling) a long-dated option and writing (buying) a shorter-dated option of the same type with the same exercise price. A long (short) calendar spread is used when the investment outlook is flat (volatile) in the near term but greater (lesser) return movements are expected in the future. Implied volatility is the expected volatility an underlying asset’s return and is derived from an option pricing model (i.e., the Black–Scholes–Merton model) as the value that equates the model price of an option to its market price. When implied volatilities of OTM options exceed those of ATM options, the implied volatility curve is a volatility smile. The more common shape is a volatility skew, in which implied volatility increases for OTM puts and decreases for OTM calls, as the strike price moves away from the current price. The implied volatility surface is a 3-D plot, for put and call options on the same underlying, showing expiration time ( x -axis), strike prices ( y -axis), and implied volatilities ( z -axis). It simultaneously displays volatility skew and the term structure of implied volatility. Options, like all derivatives, should always be used in connection with a well-defined investment objective. When using options strategies, it is important to have a view on the expected change in implied volatility and the direction of movement of the underlying asset.

Models using multiple factors are used by asset owners, asset managers, investment consultants, and risk managers for a variety of portfolio construction, portfolio management, risk management, and general analytical purposes. In comparison to single-factor models (typically based on a market risk factor), multifactor models offer increased explanatory power and flexibility. These comparative strengths of multifactor models allow practitioners to build portfolios that replicate or modify in a desired way the characteristics of a particular index; establish desired exposures to one or more risk factors, including those that express specific macro expectations (such as views on inflation or economic growth), in portfolios; perform granular risk and return attribution on actively managed portfolios; understand the comparative risk exposures of equity, fixed-income, and other asset class returns; identify active decisions relative to a benchmark and measure the sizing of those decisions; and ensure that an investor’s aggregate portfolio is meeting active risk and return objectives commensurate with active fees. Multifactor models have come to dominate investment practice, having demonstrated their value in helping asset managers and asset owners address practical tasks in measuring and controlling risk. We explain and illustrate the various practical uses of multifactor models. We first describe the modern portfolio theory background of multifactor models. We then describe arbitrage pricing theory and provide a general expression for multifactor models. We subsequently explore the types of multifactor models and certain applications. Lastly, we summarize major points.","The member should be able to: describe arbitrage pricing theory (APT), including its underlying assumptions and its relation to multifactor models; define arbitrage opportunity and determine whether an arbitrage opportunity exists; calculate the expected return on an asset given an asset’s factor sensitivities and the factor risk premiums; describe and compare macroeconomic factor models, fundamental factor models, and statistical factor models; explain sources of active risk and interpret tracking risk and the information ratio; describe uses of multifactor models and interpret the output of analyses based on multifactor models; describe the potential benefits for investors in considering multiple risk dimensions when modeling asset returns.","In our coverage of multifactor models, we have presented concepts, models, and tools that are key ingredients to quantitative portfolio management and are used to both construct portfolios and to attribute sources of risk and return. Multifactor models permit a nuanced view of risk that is more granular than the single-factor approach allows. Multifactor models describe the return on an asset in terms of the risk of the asset with respect to a set of factors. Such models generally include systematic factors, which explain the average returns of a large number of risky assets. Such factors represent priced risk—risk for which investors require an additional return for bearing. The arbitrage pricing theory (APT) describes the expected return on an asset (or portfolio) as a linear function of the risk of the asset with respect to a set of factors. Like the CAPM, the APT describes a financial market equilibrium; however, the APT makes less strong assumptions. The major assumptions of the APT are as follows: Asset returns are described by a factor model. With many assets to choose from, asset-specific risk can be eliminated. Assets are priced such that there are no arbitrage opportunities. Multifactor models are broadly categorized according to the type of factor used: Macroeconomic factor models Fundamental factor models Statistical factor models In macroeconomic factor models, the factors are surprises in macroeconomic variables that significantly explain asset class (equity in our examples) returns. Surprise is defined as actual minus forecasted value and has an expected value of zero. The factors can be understood as affecting either the expected future cash flows of companies or the interest rate used to discount these cash flows back to the present and are meant to be uncorrelated. In fundamental factor models, the factors are attributes of stocks or companies that are important in explaining cross-sectional differences in stock prices. Among the fundamental factors are book-value-to-price ratio, market capitalization, price-to-earnings ratio, and financial leverage. In contrast to macroeconomic factor models, in fundamental models the factors are calculated as returns rather than surprises. In fundamental factor models, we generally specify the factor sensitivities (attributes) first and then estimate the factor returns through regressions. In macroeconomic factor models, however, we first develop the factor (surprise) series and then estimate the factor sensitivities through regressions. The factors of most fundamental factor models may be classified as company fundamental factors, company share-related factors, or macroeconomic factors. In statistical factor models, statistical methods are applied to a set of historical returns to determine portfolios that explain historical returns in one of two senses. In factor analysis models, the factors are the portfolios that best explain (reproduce) historical return covariances. In principal-components models, the factors are portfolios that best explain (reproduce) the historical return variances. Multifactor models have applications to return attribution, risk attribution, portfolio construction, and strategic investment decisions. A factor portfolio is a portfolio with unit sensitivity to a factor and zero sensitivity to other factors. Active return is the return in excess of the return on the benchmark. Active risk is the standard deviation of active returns. Active risk is also called tracking error or tracking risk. Active risk squared can be decomposed as the sum of active factor risk and active specific risk. The information ratio (IR) is mean active return divided by active risk (tracking error). The IR measures the increment in mean active return per unit of active risk. Factor models have uses in constructing portfolios that track market indexes and in alternative index construction. Traditionally, the CAPM approach would allocate assets between the risk-free asset and a broadly diversified index fund. Considering multiple sources of systematic risk may allow investors to improve on that result by tilting away from the market portfolio. Generally, investors would gain from accepting above average (below average) exposures to risks that they have a comparative advantage (comparative disadvantage) in bearing.

Fixed-income investments offer both. Fixed-income instruments include a broad range of publicly traded securities (such as commercial paper, notes, and bonds traded through exchanges as well as OTC) and non-publicly traded instruments (such as loans and private placements). Individual loans or fixed-income obligations may be bundled into a pool of assets supporting such instruments as asset-backed securities and covered bonds. Fixed-income portfolio managers combine these diverse instruments across issuers, maturities, and jurisdictions to meet the various needs of investors. We discuss the different roles of fixed-income securities in portfolios and explain the two main types of fixed-income mandates—liability-based mandates and total return mandates—as well as bond market liquidity. We also provide an overview of portfolio measures, instruments, and vehicles used in fixed-income portfolio management and introduce a model of how a bond position’s total expected return can be decomposed.","The member should be able to: discuss roles of fixed-income securities in portfolios and how fixed-income mandates may be classified; describe fixed-income portfolio measures of risk and return as well as correlation characteristics; describe bond market liquidity, including the differences among market sub-sectors, and discuss the effect of liquidity on fixed-income portfolio management; describe and interpret a model for fixed-income returns; discuss the use of leverage, alternative methods for leveraging, and risks that leverage creates in fixed-income portfolios; discuss differences in managing fixed-income portfolios for taxable and tax-exempt investors.","Fixed-income investments provide diversification benefits in a portfolio context. These benefits arise from the generally low correlations of fixed-income investments with other major asset classes, such as equities. Floating-rate and inflation-linked bonds can be used to hedge inflation risk. Fixed-income investments have regular cash flows, which is beneficial for the purposes of funding future liabilities. For liability-based fixed-income mandates, portfolio construction follows two main approaches—cash flow matching and duration matching—to match fixed-income assets with future liabilities. Total return mandates are generally structured to either track or outperform a benchmark. Total return mandates can be classified into various approaches according to their target active return and active risk levels. Approaches range from pure indexing to enhanced indexing to active management. Bond Portfolio Duration is the sensitivity of a portfolio of bonds to small changes in interest rates. It can be calculated as the weighted average of time to receipt of the aggregate cash flows or, more commonly, as the weighted average of the individual bond durations that comprise the portfolio. Modified Duration of a Bond Portfolio indicates the percentage change in the market value given a change in yield-to-maturity. Convexity of a bond portfolio is a second-order effect; it operates behind duration in importance and can largely be ignored for small yield changes. When convexity is added with the use of derivatives, however, it can be extremely important to returns. Effective duration and convexity of a portfolio are the relevant summary statistics when future cash flows of bonds in a portfolio are contingent on interest rate changes. Spread duration is a useful measure for determining a portfolio’s sensitivity to changes in credit spreads. It provides the approximate percentage increase (decrease) in bond price expected for a 1% decrease (increase) in credit spread. Duration times spread is a modification of the spread duration definition to incorporate the empirical observation that spread changes across the credit spectrum tend to occur on a proportional percentage basis rather than being based on absolute basis point changes. Portfolio dispersion captures the variance of the times to receipt of cash flows around the duration. It is used in measuring interest rate immunization for liabilities. Duration management is the primary tool used by fixed-income portfolio managers. Convexity supplements duration as a measure of a bond’s price sensitivity for larger movements in interest rates. Adjusting convexity can be an important portfolio management tool. For two portfolios with the same duration, the portfolio with higher convexity has higher sensitivity to large declines in yields to maturity and lower sensitivity to large increases in yields to maturity. Interest rate derivatives can be used effectively to increase or decrease duration and convexity in a bond portfolio. Liquidity is an important consideration in fixed-income portfolio management. Bonds are generally less liquid than equities, and liquidity varies greatly across sectors. Liquidity affects pricing in fixed-income markets because many bonds either do not trade or trade infrequently. Liquidity affects portfolio construction because there is a trade-off between liquidity and yield to maturity. Less liquid bonds have higher yields to maturity, all else being equal, and may be more desirable for buy-and-hold investors. Investors anticipating liquidity needs may forgo higher yields to maturity for more liquid bonds. Investors can obtain exposure to the bond market using mutual funds and ETFs that track a bond index. Shares in mutual funds are redeemable at the net asset value with a one-day time lag. ETF shares have the advantage of trading on an exchange. A total return swap, an over-the-counter derivative, allows an institutional investor to transform an asset or liability from one asset category to another—for instance, from variable-rate cash flows referencing the market reference rate to the total return on a particular bond index. A total return swap can have some advantages over a direct investment in a bond mutual fund or ETF. As a derivative, it requires less initial cash outlay than direct investment in the bond portfolio for similar performance but carries counterparty risk. As a customized over-the-counter product, a TRS can offer exposure to assets that are difficult to access directly, such as some high-yield and commercial loan investments. When evaluating fixed-income investment strategies, it is important to consider expected returns and to understand the various components of expected returns. Decomposing expected fixed-income returns allows investors to understand the different sources of returns given expected changes in bond market conditions. A model for expected fixed-income returns can decompose them into the following components: coupon income, rolldown return, expected change in price based on investor’s views of yields to maturity and yield spreads, and expected currency gains or losses. Leverage is the use of borrowed capital to increase the magnitude of portfolio positions. By using leverage, fixed-income portfolio managers may be able to increase portfolio returns relative to what they can achieve in unleveraged portfolios. The potential for increased returns, however, comes with increased risk. Methods for leveraging fixed-income portfolios include the use of futures contracts, swap agreements, repurchase agreements, structured financial instruments, and security lending. Taxes can complicate investment decisions in fixed-income portfolio management. Complications result from the differences in taxation among investor types, countries, and income sources. The two primary sources of investment income that affect taxes for fixed-income securities are coupon payments (interest income) and capital gains or losses. Tax is usually payable only on capital gains and interest income that have actually been received. Capital gains are frequently taxed at a lower effective tax rate than interest income. If capital losses exceed capital gains in the year, they can often be “carried forward” and applied to gains in future years.

While fixed-income index replication and bond portfolios that consider both an investor’s assets and liabilities were addressed earlier in the curriculum, we now turn our attention to active bond portfolio management. In contrast to a passive index strategy, active fixed-income management involves taking positions in primary risk factors that deviate from those of an index in order to generate excess return. Financial analysts who can successfully apply fixed-income concepts and tools to evaluate yield curve changes and position a portfolio based upon an interest rate view find this to be a valuable skill throughout their careers. Prioritizing fixed-income risk factors is a key first step. In what follows, we focus on the yield curve, which represents the term structure of interest rates for government or benchmark securities, with the assumption that all promised principal and interest payments take place. Fixed-income securities, which trade at a spread above the benchmark to compensate investors for credit and liquidity risk, will be addressed later in the curriculum. The starting point for active portfolio managers is the current term structure of benchmark interest rates and an interest rate view established using macroeconomic variables introduced earlier. In what follows, we demonstrate how managers may position a fixed-income portfolio to capitalize on expectations regarding the level, slope, or shape (curvature) of yield curves using both long and short cash positions, derivatives, and leverage.","The member should be able to: describe the factors affecting fixed-income portfolio returns due to a change in benchmark yields; formulate a portfolio positioning strategy given forward interest rates and an interest rate view that coincides with the market view; formulate a portfolio positioning strategy given forward interest rates and an interest rate view that diverges from the market view in terms of rate level, slope, and shape; formulate a portfolio positioning strategy based upon expected changes in interest rate volatility; evaluate a portfolio’s sensitivity using key rate durations of the portfolio and its benchmark; discuss yield curve strategies across currencies; evaluate the expected return and risks of a yield curve strategy.","This reading addresses active fixed-income yield curve management using cash- and derivative-based strategies to generate returns which exceed those of a benchmark index due to yield curve changes. The following are the main points in the reading: A par yield curve is a stylized representation of yields-to-maturity available to investors at various maturities, which often does not consist of traded securities but must be extracted from available bond yields using a model. Primary yield curve risk factors may be categorized by changes in level (or a parallel “shift”), slope (a flatter or steeper yield curve), and shape or curvature. Yield curve slope measures the difference between the yield-to-maturity on a long-maturity bond and the yield-to-maturity on a shorter-maturity bond. Curvature is the relationship between short-, intermediate-, and long-term yields-to-maturity. Fixed-income portfolio managers can approximate actual and anticipated bond portfolio value changes using portfolio duration and convexity measures. Duration measures the linear relationship between bond prices and yield-to-maturity. Convexity is a second-order effect describing a bond’s price behavior for larger rate movements and is affected by cash flow dispersion. A barbell portfolio combining short- and long-term bond positions will have greater convexity than a bullet portfolio concentrated in a single maturity for a given duration. Active managers seeking excess return in an expected static yield curve environment that is upward-sloping can use a buy-and-hold strategy to increase duration, roll down the yield curve, or use leverage via a carry trade in cash markets. Receive-fixed swaps and long futures positions replicate this exposure in the derivatives market. Derivatives offer the opportunity to synthetically change exposure with a far smaller initial cash outlay than cash strategies but require managers to maintain sufficient cash or eligible securities to fulfill margin or collateral requirements. Active fixed-income managers with a divergent rate level view increase duration exposure above a target if yields-to-maturity are expected to decline and reduce duration if expecting higher yields-to-maturity to minimize losses. Yield curve steepeners seek to gain from a greater spread between short- and long-term yields-to-maturity by combining a “long” short-dated bond position with a “short” long-dated bond position, while a flattener involves sale of short-term bonds and purchase of long-term bonds. Steepener and flattener strategies may be net duration neutral or net long or short duration depending upon a manager’s view of how the yield curve slope will change—that is, the relative contribution of short- and long-term yield-to-maturity changes to the expected yield curve slope change. The butterfly strategy combining a long bullet with a short barbell portfolio (or vice versa) is commonly used to capitalize on expected yield curve shape changes. Active managers capitalize on a view as to whether future realized interest rate volatility will be greater or less than implied volatility by purchasing or selling bonds with embedded options or by using stand-alone interest rate options. Stand-alone interest rate put and call options are generally based upon a bond’s price, not yield-to-maturity. Interest rate swaptions and options on bond futures are among the common tools used by active managers to alter portfolio duration and convexity subject to yield-to-maturity changes. An interest rate swaption involves the right to enter into an interest rate swap at a specific strike price in the future, while an option on a bond future involves the right, not the obligation, to buy or sell a futures contract. Key rate durations can be used in active fixed-income management to identify a bond portfolio’s sensitivity to changes in the shape of the benchmark yield curve, allowing an active manager to quantify exposures along the curve. Fixed-income managers engaged in active yield curve strategies across currencies measure excess return from active management in functional currency terms—that is, considering domestic currency returns on foreign currency assets within a portfolio. Interest rate parity establishes the fundamental relationship between spot and forward exchange rates, with a higher-yielding currency trading at a forward discount and a lower-yielding currency trading at a premium. Covered interest rate parity involves the use of a forward contract to lock in domestic currency proceeds, while uncovered interest rate parity suggests that over time, the returns on unhedged foreign currency exposure will be the same as on a domestic currency investment. Active investors use the carry trade across currencies to take advantage of divergence from interest rate parity by borrowing in a lower-yield currency and investing in a higher-yield currency. A cross-currency swap enables investors to fully hedge the domestic currency value of cash flows associated with foreign currency bonds. Active managers deviate from fully hedged foreign currency bond cash flows by entering overweight and underweight bond positions denominated in different currencies, often using an underweight position in one currency to fund an overweight position in another. Investors evaluate the expected return on an active fixed-income portfolio strategy by combining coupon income and rolldown return with expected portfolio changes based on benchmark yield-to-maturity, credit, and currency value changes over the investment horizon. Unexpected market changes or risks to portfolio value are frequently evaluated using scenario analysis.

Although they mean different things, passive equity investing and indexing have become nearly synonymous in the investment industry. Indexing refers to strategies intended to replicate the performance of benchmark indexes, such as the S&P 500 Index, the Topix 100, the FTSE 100, and the MSCI All-Country World Index. The main advantages of indexing include low costs, broad diversification, and tax efficiency. Indexing is the purest form of a more general idea: passive investing. Passive investing refers to any rules-based, transparent, and investable strategy that does not involve identifying mispriced individual securities. Unlike indexing, however, passive investing can include investing in a changing set of market segments that are selected by the portfolio manager. Studies over the years have reported support for passive investing. Renshaw and Feldstein (1960) observe that the returns of professionally managed portfolios trailed the returns on the principal index of that time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average. They also conclude that the index would be a good basis for what they termed an “unmanaged investment company.” French (2008) indicates that the cost of passive investing is lower than the cost of active management. Further motivation for passive investing comes from studies that examine the return and risk consequences of stock selection, which involves identifying mispriced securities. This differs from asset allocation, which involves selecting asset class investments that are, themselves, essentially passive indexed-based portfolios. Brinson, Hood, and Beebower (1986) find a dominant role for asset allocation rather than security selection in explaining return variability. With passive investing, portfolio managers eschew the idea of security selection, concluding that the benefits do not justify the costs. The efficient market hypothesis gave credence to investors’ interest in indexes by theorizing that stock prices incorporate all relevant information—implying that after costs, the majority of active investors could not consistently outperform the market. With this backdrop, investment managers began to offer strategies to replicate the returns of stock market indexes as early as 1971. In comparison with passive investing strategies, active management of an investment portfolio requires a substantial commitment of personnel, technological resources, and time spent on analysis and management that can involve significant costs. Consequently, passive portfolio fees charged to investors are generally much lower than fees charged by their active managers. This fee differential represents the most significant and enduring advantage of passive management. Another advantage is that passive managers seeking to track an index can generally achieve their objective. Passive managers model their clients’ portfolios to the benchmark’s constituent securities and weights as reported by the index provider, thereby replicating the benchmark. The skill of a passive manager is apparent in the ability to trade, report, and explain the performance of a client’s portfolio. Gross-of-fees performance among passive managers tends to be similar, so much of the industry views passive managers as undifferentiated apart from their scope of offerings and client-servicing capabilities. Investors of passively managed funds may seek market return, otherwise known as beta exposure, and do not seek outperformance, known as alpha. A focus on beta is based on a single-factor model: the capital asset pricing model. Since the turn of the millennium, passive factor-based strategies, which are based on more than a single factor, have become more prevalent as investors gain a different understanding of what drives investment returns. These strategies maintain the low-cost advantage of index funds and provide a different expected return stream based on exposure to such factors as style, capitalization, volatility, and quality. This reading contains the following sections. Section 2 focuses on how to choose a passive benchmark, including weighting considerations. Section 3 looks at how to gain exposure to the desired index, whether through a pooled investment, a derivatives-based approach, or a separately managed account. Section 4 describes passive portfolio construction techniques. Section 5 discusses how a portfolio manager can control tracking error against the benchmark, including the sources of tracking error. Section 6 introduces methods a portfolio manager can use to attribute the sources of return in the portfolio, including country returns, currency returns, sector returns, and security returns. This section also describes sources of portfolio risk. A summary of key points concludes the reading.","The member should be able to: discuss considerations in choosing a benchmark for a passively managed equity portfolio; compare passive factor-based strategies to market-capitalization-weighted indexing; compare different approaches to passive equity investing; compare the full replication, stratified sampling, and optimization approaches for the construction of passively managed equity portfolios; discuss potential causes of tracking error and methods to control tracking error for passively managed equity portfolios; explain sources of return and risk to a passively managed equity portfolio.","This reading explains the rationale for passive investing as well as the construction of equity market indexes and the various methods by which investors can track the indexes. Passive portfolio managers must understand benchmark index construction and the advantages and disadvantages of the various methods used to track index performance. Among the key points made in this reading are the following: Active equity portfolio managers who focus on individual security selection have long been unsuccessful at beating benchmarks and have charged high management fees to their end investors. Consequently, passive investing has increased in popularity. Passive equity investors seek to track the return of benchmark indexes and construct their portfolios to reflect the characteristics of the chosen benchmarks. Selection of a benchmark is driven by the equity investor’s objectives and constraints as presented in the investment policy statement. The benchmark index must be rules-based, transparent, and investable. Specific important characteristics include the domestic or foreign market covered, the market capitalization of the constituent stocks, where the index falls in the value–growth spectrum, and other risk factors. The equity benchmark index weighting scheme is another important consideration for investors. Weighting methods include market-cap weighting, price weighting, equal weighting, and fundamental weighting. Market cap-weighting has several advantages, including the fact that weights adjust automatically. Index rebalancing and reconstitution policies are important features. Rebalancing involves adjusting the portfolio’s constituent weights after price changes, mergers, or other corporate events have caused those weights to deviate from the benchmark index. Reconstitution involves deleting names that are no longer in the index and adding names that have been approved as new index members. Increasingly, passive investors use index-based strategies to gain exposure to individual risk factors. Examples of known equity risk factors include Capitalization, Style, Yield, Momentum, Volatility, and Quality. For passive investors, portfolio tracking error is the standard deviation of the portfolio return net of the benchmark return. Indexing involves the goal of minimizing tracking error subject to realistic portfolio constraints. Methods of pursuing passive investing include the use of such pooled investments as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a do-it-yourself approach of building the portfolio stock-by-stock, and using derivatives to obtain exposure. Conventional open-end index mutual funds generally maintain low fees. Their expense ratios are slightly higher than for ETFs, but a brokerage fee is usually required for investor purchases and sales of ETF shares. Index exposure can also be obtained through the use of derivatives, such as futures and swaps. Building a passive portfolio by full replication, meaning to hold all the index constituents, requires a large-scale portfolio and high-quality information about the constituent characteristics. Most equity index portfolios are managed using either a full replication strategy to keep tracking error low, are sampled to keep trading costs low, or use optimization techniques to match as closely as possible the characteristics and performance of the underlying index. The principal sources of passive portfolio tracking error are fees, trading costs, and cash drag. Cash drag refers to the dilution of the return on the equity assets because of cash held. Cash drag can be exacerbated by the receipt of dividends from constituent stocks and the delay in getting them converted into shares. Portfolio managers control tracking error by minimizing trading costs, netting investor cash inflows and redemptions, and using equitization tools like derivatives to compensate for cash drag. Many index fund managers offer the constituent securities held in their portfolios for lending to short sellers and other market participants. The income earned from lending those securities helps offset portfolio management costs, often resulting in lower net fees to investors. Investor activism is engagement with portfolio companies and recognizing the primacy of end investors. Forms of activism can include expressing views to company boards or management on executive compensation, operational risk, board governance, and other value-relevant matters. Successful passive equity investment requires an understanding of the investor’s needs, benchmark index construction, and methods available to track the index.

It is thus not surprising that bonds are a critical component of most investment portfolios. In our coverage of structured and passive total return fixed-income investment strategies, we explain that “passive” does not simply mean “buy and hold.” The primary strategies discussed—immunization and indexation—can entail frequent rebalancing of the bond portfolio. We also note that “passive” stands in contrast to “active” fixed-income strategies that are based on the asset manager’s particular view on interest rate and credit market conditions. We explain liability-driven investing by demonstrating how to best structure a fixed-income portfolio when considering both the asset and liability sides of the investor’s balance sheet. It is first important to have a thorough understanding of both the timing and relative certainty of future financial obligations. Because it is rare to find a bond investment whose characteristics perfectly match one’s obligations, we introduce the idea of structuring a bond portfolio to match the future cash flows of one or more liabilities that have bond-like characteristics. Asset–liability management (ALM) strategies are based on the concept that investors incorporate both rate-sensitive assets and liabilities into the portfolio decision-making process. When the liabilities are given and assets are managed, liability-driven investing (LDI), a common type of ALM strategy, may be used to ensure adequate funding for an insurance portfolio, a pension plan, or an individual’s budget after retirement. The techniques and risks associated with LDI are introduced using a single liability and then are expanded to cover both cash flow and duration-matching techniques and multiple liabilities. This strategy, known as immunization, may be viewed simply as a special case of interest rate hedging. We then turn our attention to index-based investment strategies, through which investors gain a broader exposure to fixed-income markets, rather than tailoring investments to match a specific liability profile. We explain the advantages of index-based investing, such as diversification, but we also note that the depth and breadth of bond markets make both creating and tracking an index more challenging than in the equity markets. We also explore a variety of alternatives in matching a bond index, from full replication to enhanced indexing using primary risk factors. Finally, we explain that it is critical to select a benchmark that is most relevant to a specific investor based on factors such as the targeted duration profile and risk appetite.","The member should be able to: describe liability-driven investing; evaluate strategies for managing a single liability; compare strategies for a single liability and for multiple liabilities, including alternative means of implementation; describe construction, benefits, limitations, and risk–return characteristics of a laddered bond portfolio; evaluate liability-based strategies under various interest rate scenarios and select a strategy to achieve a portfolio’s objectives; explain risks associated with managing a portfolio against a liability structure; discuss bond indexes and the challenges of managing a fixed-income portfolio to mimic the characteristics of a bond index; compare alternative methods for establishing bond market exposure passively; discuss criteria for selecting a benchmark and justify the selection of a benchmark.","Structured fixed-income investing requires a frame of reference, such as a balance sheet, to structure the bond portfolio. This frame of reference can be as simple as the time to retirement for an individual or as complex as a balance sheet of rate-sensitive assets and liabilities for a company. Assets and liabilities can be categorized by the degree of certainty surrounding the amount and timing of cash flows. Type I assets and liabilities, such as traditional fixed-rate bonds with no embedded options, have known amounts and payment dates. For Type I assets and liabilities, such yield duration statistics as Macaulay, modified, and money duration apply. Type II, III, and IV assets and liabilities have uncertain amounts and/or uncertain timing of payment. For Type II, III, and IV assets and liabilities, curve duration statistics, such as effective duration, are needed. A model is used to obtain the estimated values when the yield curve shifts up and down by the same amount. Immunization is the process of structuring and managing a fixed-income portfolio to minimize the variance in the realized rate of return over a known investment horizon. In the case of a single liability, immunization is achieved by matching the Macaulay duration of the bond portfolio to the horizon date. As time passes and bond yields change, the duration of the bonds changes and the portfolio needs to be rebalanced. This rebalancing can be accomplished by buying and selling bonds or using interest rate derivatives, such as futures contracts and interest rate swaps. An immunization strategy aims to lock in the cash flow yield on the portfolio, which is the internal rate of return on the cash flows. It is not the weighted average of the yields to maturity on the bonds that constitute the portfolio. The risk to immunization is that as the yield curve shifts and twists, the cash flow yield on the bond portfolio does not match the change in the yield on the zero-coupon bond that would provide for perfect immunization. A sufficient, but not necessary, condition for immunization is a parallel (or shape-preserving) shift whereby all yields change by the same amount in the same direction. If the change in the cash flow yield is the same as that on the zero-coupon bond being replicated, immunization can be achieved even with a non-parallel shift to the yield curve. Structural risk to immunization arises from some non-parallel shifts and twists to the yield curve. This risk is reduced by minimizing the dispersion of cash flows in the portfolio, which can be accomplished by minimizing the convexity statistic for the portfolio. Concentrating the cash flows around the horizon date makes the immunizing portfolio closely track the zero-coupon bond that provides for perfect immunization. For multiple liabilities, one method of immunization is cash flow matching. A portfolio of high-quality zero-coupon or fixed-income bonds is purchased to match as closely as possible the amount and timing of the liabilities. A motive for cash flow matching can be accounting defeasance, whereby both the assets and liabilities are removed from the balance sheet. A laddered bond portfolio is a common investment strategy in the wealth management industry. The laddered portfolio offers “diversification” over the yield curve compared with “bullet” or “barbell” portfolios. This structure is especially attractive in stable, upwardly sloped yield curve environments as maturing short-term debt is replaced with higher-yielding long-term debt at the back of the ladder. A laddered portfolio offers an increase in convexity because the cash flows have greater dispersions than a more concentrated (bullet) portfolio. A laddered portfolio provides liquidity in that it always contains a soon-to-mature bond that could provide high-quality, low-duration collateral on a repo contract if needed. Immunization of multiple liabilities can be achieved by structuring and managing a portfolio of fixed-income bonds. Because the market values of the assets and liabilities differ, the strategy is to match the money durations. The money duration is the modified duration multiplied by the market value. The basis point value is a measure of money duration calculated by multiplying the money duration by 0.0001. The conditions to immunize multiple liabilities are that (1) the market value of assets is greater than or equal to the market value of the liabilities, (2) the asset basis point value (BPV) equals the liability BPV, and (3) the dispersion of cash flows and the convexity of assets are greater than those of the liabilities. A derivatives overlay—for example, interest rate futures contracts—can be used to immunize single or multiple liabilities. The number of futures contracts needed to immunize is the liability BPV minus the asset BPV, divided by the futures BPV. If the result is a positive number, the entity buys, or goes long, futures contracts. If the result is a negative number, the entity sells, or goes short, futures contracts. The futures BPV can be approximated by the BPV for the cheapest-to-deliver security divided by the conversion factor for the cheapest-to-deliver security. Contingent immunization adds active management of the surplus, which is the difference between the asset and liability market values, with the intent to reduce the overall cost of retiring the liabilities. In principle, any asset classes can be used for the active investment. The entity can choose to over-hedge or under-hedge the number of futures contracts needed for passive immunization. Liability-driven investing (LDI) often is used for complex rate-sensitive liabilities, such as those for a defined benefit pension plan. The retirement benefits for covered employees depend on many variables, such as years of employment, age at retirement, wage level at retirement, and expected lifetime. There are different measures for the liabilities: for instance, the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) that is based on current wages and the projected benefit obligation (PBO) that is based on expected future wages. For each liability measure (ABO or PBO), a model is used to extract the effective duration and BPV. Interest rate swap overlays can be used to reduce the duration gap as measured by the asset and liability BPVs. There often is a large gap because pension funds hold sizable asset positions in equities that have low or zero effective durations and their liability durations are high. The hedging ratio is the percentage of the duration gap that is closed with the derivatives. A hedging ratio of zero implies no hedging. A hedging ratio of 100% implies immunization—that is, complete removal of interest rate risk. Strategic hedging is the active management of the hedging ratio. Because asset BPVs are less than liability BPVs in typical pension funds, the derivatives overlay requires the use of receive-fixed interest rate swaps. Because receive-fixed swaps gain value as current swap market rates fall, the fund manager could choose to raise the hedging ratio when lower rates are anticipated. If rates are expected to go up, the manager could strategically reduce the hedging ratio. An alternative to the receive-fixed interest rate swap is a purchased receiver swaption. This swaption confers to the buyer the right to enter the swap as the fixed-rate receiver. Because of its negative duration gap (asset BPV is less than liability BPV), the typical pension plan suffers when interest rates fall and could become underfunded. The gain on the receiver swaption as rates decline offsets the losses on the balance sheet. Another alternative is a swaption collar, the combination of buying the receiver swaption and writing a payer swaption. The premium received on the payer swaption that is written offsets the premium needed to buy the receiver swaption. The choice among hedging with the receive-fixed swap, the purchased receiver swaption, and the swaption collar depends in part on the pension fund manager’s view on future interest rates. If rates are expected to be low, the receive-fixed swap typically is the preferred derivative. If rates are expected to go up, the swaption collar can become attractive. And if rates are projected to reach a certain threshold that depends on the option costs and the strike rates, the purchased receiver swaption can become the favored choice. Model risks arise in LDI strategies because of the many assumptions in the models and approximations used to measure key parameters. For example, the liability BPV for the defined benefit pension plan depends on the choice of measure (ABO or PBO) and the assumptions that go into the model regarding future events (e.g., wage levels, time of retirement, and time of death). Spread risk in LDI strategies arises because it is common to assume equal changes in asset, liability, and hedging instrument yields when calculating the number of futures contracts, or the notional principal on an interest rate swap, to attain a particular hedging ratio. The assets and liabilities are often on corporate securities, however, and their spreads to benchmark yields can vary over time. Investing in a fund that tracks a bond market index offers the benefits of both diversification and low administrative costs. Tracking risk arises when the fund manager chooses to buy only a subset of the index, a strategy called enhanced indexing, because fully replicating the index can be impractical as a result of the large number of bonds in the fixed-income universe. Corporate bonds are often illiquid. Matrix pricing uses available data on comparable securities to estimate the fair value of the illiquid bonds. The primary risk factors encountered by an investor tracking a bond index include decisions regarding duration (option-adjusted duration for callable bonds, convexity for possible large yield shifts, and key rate durations for non-parallel shifts) and portfolio weights (assigned by sector, credit quality, maturity, coupon rate, and issuer). Index replication is one method to establish a passive exposure to the bond market. The manager buys or sells bonds only when there are changes to the index. Full replication can be expensive, however, as well as infeasible for broad-based fixed-income indexes that include many illiquid bonds. Several enhancement strategies can reduce the costs to track a bond index: lowering trading costs, using models to identify undervalued bonds and to gauge relative value at varying points along the yield curve, over/under weighting specific credit sectors over the business cycle, and evaluating specific call features to identify value given large yield changes. Investors can obtain passive exposure to the bond market using ETFs or mutual funds. Exchange-traded fund (ETF) shares have the advantage of trading on an exchange throughout the day. A total return swap, an over-the-counter derivative, allows an institutional investor to transform an asset or liability from one asset category to another—for instance, from variable-rate cash flows referencing the MRR to the total return on a particular bond index. A total return swap (TRS) can have some advantages over a direct investment in a bond mutual fund or ETF. As a derivative, it requires less initial cash outlay than direct investment in the bond portfolio for similar performance. A TRS also carries counterparty credit risk, however. As a customized over-the-counter product, a TRS can offer exposure to assets that are difficult to access directly, such as some high-yield and commercial loan investments. Selecting a particular bond index is a major decision for a fixed-income investment manager. Selection is guided by the specified goals and objectives for the investment. The decision should recognize several features of bond indexes: (1) Given that bonds have finite maturities, the duration of the index drifts down over time; (2) the composition of the index changes over time with the business cycle and maturity preferences of issuers.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level3/RR_2024_L3V4R1_hedge_fund_strategies.pdf,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,2024,Level III,"Hedge funds form an important subset of the alternative investments opportunity set, but they come with many pros and cons in their use and application across different asset classes and investment approaches. The basic tradeoff is whether the added fees typically involved with hedge fund investing result in sufficient additional alpha and portfolio diversification benefits to justify the high fee levels. This is an ongoing industry debate. Some argue that investing in hedge funds is a key way to access the very best investment talent—those individuals who can adroitly navigate investment opportunities across a potentially wider universe of markets. Others argue that hedge funds are important because the alpha that may be produced in down markets is hard to source elsewhere. The arguments against hedge funds are also non-trivial. In addition to the high fee levels, the complex offering memorandum documentation needs to be understood by investors (i.e., the limited partners). Other issues include lack of full underlying investment transparency/attribution, higher cost allocations associated with the establishment and maintenance of the fund investment structures, and generally longer–lived investment commitment periods with limited redemption availability. In addition, each hedge fund strategy area tends to introduce different types of added portfolio risks. For example, to achieve meaningful return objectives, arbitrage-oriented hedge fund strategies tend to utilize significant leverage that can be dangerous to limited partner investors, especially during periods of market stress. Long/short equity and event-driven strategies may have less beta exposure than simple, long-only beta allocations, but the higher hedge fund fees effectively result in a particularly expensive form of embedded beta. Such strategies as managed futures or global macro investing may introduce natural benefits of asset class and investment approach diversification, but they come with naturally higher volatility in the return profiles typically delivered. Extreme tail risk in portfolios may be managed with the inclusion of relative value volatility or long volatility strategies, but it comes at the cost of a return drag during more normal market periods. In other words, some hedge fund strategies may have higher portfolio diversification benefits, while others may simply be return enhancers rather than true portfolio diversifiers. Also, the hedge fund industry continues to evolve in its overall structure. Over the past decade, traditional limited partnership formats have been supplemented by offerings of liquid alternatives (liquid alts)—which are mutual fund, closed-end fund, and ETF-type vehicles that invest in various hedge fund-like strategies. Liquid alts are meant to provide daily liquidity, transparency, and lower fees while opening hedge fund investing to a wider range of investors. However, empirical evidence shows that liquid alts significantly underperform similar strategy hedge funds, which suggests that traditional hedge funds may be benefiting from an illiquidity premium phenomenon that cannot be easily transported into a mutual fund format. Investors must understand the various subtleties involved with investing in hedge funds. Although secular bull market trends have arguably made “hedged” strategies less critical for inclusion in portfolio allocations than they were during the mid-to-late 2000s, the overall popularity of hedge funds tends to be somewhat cyclical. Notably, as demonstrated by the endowment model of investing, placing hedge funds as a core allocation can increase net returns and reduce risk. This reading presents the investment characteristics and implementation for the major categories of hedge fund strategies. It also provides a framework for classifying and evaluating these strategies based on their risk profiles. Section 2 summarizes some distinctive regulatory and investment characteristics of hedge funds and discusses ways to classify hedge fund strategies. Sections 3 through 8 present investment characteristics and strategy implementation for each of the following six hedge fund strategy categories: equity-related; event-driven; relative value; opportunistic; specialist; and multi-manager strategies. Section 9 introduces a conditional factor model as a unifying framework for understanding and analyzing the risk exposures of these strategies. Section 10 evaluates the contributions of each hedge fund strategy to the return and risk profile of a traditional portfolio of stocks and bonds. The reading concludes with a summary.","The member should be able to: discuss how hedge fund strategies may be classified; discuss investment characteristics, strategy implementation, and role in a portfolio of equity-related hedge fund strategies; discuss investment characteristics, strategy implementation, and role in a portfolio of event-driven hedge fund strategies; discuss investment characteristics, strategy implementation, and role in a portfolio of relative value hedge fund strategies; discuss investment characteristics, strategy implementation, and role in a portfolio of opportunistic hedge fund strategies; discuss investment characteristics, strategy implementation, and role in a portfolio of specialist hedge fund strategies; discuss investment characteristics, strategy implementation, and role in a portfolio of multi-manager hedge fund strategies; describe how factor models may be used to understand hedge fund risk exposures; evaluate the impact of an allocation to a hedge fund strategy in a traditional investment portfolio.","Hedge funds are an important subset of the alternative investments space. Key characteristics distinguishing hedge funds and their strategies from traditional investments include the following: 1) lower legal and regulatory constraints; 2) flexible mandates permitting use of shorting and derivatives; 3) a larger investment universe on which to focus; 4) aggressive investment styles that allow concentrated positions in securities offering exposure to credit, volatility, and liquidity risk premiums; 5) relatively liberal use of leverage; 6) liquidity constraints that include lock-ups and liquidity gates; and 7) relatively high fee structures involving management and incentive fees. Hedge fund strategies are classified by a combination of the instruments in which they are invested, the trading philosophy followed, and the types of risks assumed. Some leading hedge fund strategy index providers are Hedge Fund Research; Lipper TASS; Morningstar Hedge/CISDM; Eurekahedge; and Credit Suisse. There is much heterogeneity in the classification and indexes they provide, so no one index group is all-encompassing. This reading classifies hedge fund strategies by the following categories: equity-related strategies; event-driven strategies; relative value strategies; opportunistic strategies; specialist strategies; and multi-manager strategies. Equity L/S strategies take advantage of diverse opportunities globally to create alpha via managers’ skillful stock picking. Diverse investment styles include value/growth, large cap/small cap, discretionary/quantitative, and industry specialization. Some equity L/S strategies may use index-based short hedges to reduce market risk, but most involve single name shorts for portfolio alpha and added absolute return. Equity L/S strategies are typically liquid and generally net long, with gross exposures at 70%–90% long vs. 20%–50% short (but they can vary). Equity L/S return profiles are typically aimed to achieve average annual returns roughly equivalent to a long-only approach but with standard deviations that are 50% lower. The more market-neutral or quantitative the strategy approach, the more levered the strategy application to achieve a meaningful return profile. Dedicated short sellers only trade with short-side exposure, but they may moderate short beta by also holding cash. Short-biased managers are focused on short-side stock picking, but they typically moderate short beta with some value-oriented long exposure and cash. Dedicated short strategies tend to be 60%–120% short at all times, while short-biased strategies are typically around 30%–60% net short. The focus in both cases is usually on single equity stock picking, as opposed to index shorting, and using little if any leverage. Dedicated short-selling and short-biased strategies have return goals that are typically less than most other hedge fund strategies but with a negative correlation benefit. Returns are more volatile than a typical L/S equity hedge fund given short beta exposure. Equity market-neutral (EMN) strategies take advantage of idiosyncratic short-term mispricing between securities. Their sources of return and alpha do not require accepting beta risk, so EMN strategies are especially attractive in periods of market vulnerability/weakness. There are many types of EMN managers, but most are purely quantitative managers (vs. discretionary managers). As many beta risks (e.g., market, sector) are hedged away, EMN strategies generally apply relatively high levels of leverage in striving for meaningful return targets. Equity market-neutral strategies exhibit relatively modest return profiles. Portfolios are aimed at market neutrality and with differing constraints to other factor/sector exposures. Generally high levels of diversification and liquidity with lower standard deviation of returns are typical due to an orientation toward mean reversion. Merger arbitrage is a relatively liquid strategy. Defined gains come from idiosyncratic, single security takeover situations, but occasional downside shocks can occur when merger deals unexpectedly fail. Cross-border M&A usually involves two sets of governmental approvals. M&A deals involving vertical integration often face antitrust scrutiny and thus carry higher risks and offer wider merger spread returns. Merger arbitrage strategies have return profiles that are insurance-like, plus a short put option, with relatively high Sharpe ratios; however, left-tail risk is associated with otherwise steady returns. Merger arbitrage managers typically apply moderate to high leverage to generate meaningful target return levels. Distressed securities strategies focus on firms in bankruptcy, facing potential bankruptcy, or under financial stress. Hedge fund managers seek inefficiently priced securities before, during, or after the bankruptcy process, which results in either liquidation or reorganization. In liquidation, the firm’s assets are sold off and securities holders are paid sequentially based on priority of their claims—from senior secured debt, junior secured debt, unsecured debt, convertible debt, preferred stock, and finally common stock. In re-organization, a firm’s capital structure is re-organized and terms for current claims are negotiated and revised. Debtholders either may agree to maturity extensions or to exchanging their debt for new equity shares (existing shares are canceled) that are sold to new investors to improve the firm’s financial condition. Outright shorts or hedged positions are possible, but distressed securities investing is usually long-biased, entails relatively high levels of illiquidity, and has moderate to low leverage. The return profile is typically at the higher end of event-driven strategies, but it is more discrete and cyclical. For fixed-income arbitrage, the attractiveness of returns is a function of the correlations between different securities, the yield spread pick-up available, and the high number and wide diversity of debt securities across different markets, each having different credit quality and convexity aspects in their pricing. Yield curve and carry trades within the US government space are very liquid but have the fewest mispricing opportunities. Liquidity for relative value positions generally decreases in other sovereign markets, mortgage-related markets, and across corporate debt markets. Fixed-income arbitrage involves high leverage usage, but leverage availability diminishes with trade and underlying instrument complexity. Convertible arbitrage strategies strive to extract “underpriced” implied volatility from long convertible bond holdings. To do this, managers will delta hedge and gamma trade short equity positions against their convertible positions. Convertible arbitrage works best in periods of high convertible issuance, moderate volatility, and reasonable market liquidity. Liquidity issues may arise from convertible bonds being naturally less-liquid securities due to their relatively small issue sizes and inherent complexities as well as the availability and cost to borrow underlying equity for short selling. Convertible arbitrage managers typically run convertible portfolios at 300% long vs. 200% short. The lower short exposure is a function of the delta-adjusted exposure needed from short sales to balance the long convertibles. Global macro strategies focus on correctly discerning and capitalizing on trends in global financial markets using a wide range of instruments. Managed futures strategies have a similar aim but focus on investments using mainly futures and options on futures, on stock and fixed-income indexes, as well as on commodities and currencies. Managed futures strategies typically are implemented via more systematic approaches, while global macro strategies tend to use more discretionary approaches. Both strategies are highly liquid and use high leverage. Returns of managed futures strategies typically exhibit positive right-tail skewness during market stress. Global macro strategies generally deliver similar diversification in stress periods but with more heterogeneous outcomes. Specialist hedge fund strategies require highly specialized skill sets for trading in niche markets. Two such typical specialist strategies—which are aimed at generating uncorrelated, attractive risk-adjusted returns—are volatility trading and reinsurance/life settlements. Volatility traders strive to capture relative timing and strike pricing opportunities due to changes in the term structure of volatility. They try to capture volatility smile and skew by using various types of option spreads, such as bull and bear spreads, straddles, and calendar spreads. In addition to using exchange-listed and OTC options, VIX futures, volatility swaps, and variance swaps can be used to implement volatility trading strategies. Life settlements strategies involve analyzing pools of life insurance contracts offered by third-party brokers, where the hedge fund purchases the pool and effectively becomes the beneficiary. The hedge fund manager looks for policies with the following traits: 1) The surrender value being offered to the insured individual is relatively low; 2) the ongoing premium payments are also relatively low; and 3) the probability is relatively high that the insured person will die sooner than predicted by standard actuarial methods. Funds-of-funds and multi-strategy funds typically offer steady, low-volatility returns via their strategy diversification. Multi-strategy funds have generally outperformed FoFs, but they have more variance due to using relatively high leverage. Multi-strategy funds offer potentially faster tactical asset allocation and generally improved fee structure (netting risk between strategies is often at least partially absorbed by the general partner), but they have higher manager-specific operational risks. FoFs offer a potentially more diverse strategy mix, but they have less transparency, slower tactical reaction time, and contribute netting risk to the FoF investor. Conditional linear factor models can be useful for uncovering and analyzing hedge fund strategy risk exposures. This reading uses such a model that incorporates four factors for assessing risk exposures in both normal periods and market stress/crisis periods: equity risk, credit risk, currency risk, and volatility risk. Adding a 20% allocation of a hedge fund strategy group to a traditional 60%/40% portfolio (for a 48% stocks/32% bonds/20% hedge funds portfolio) typically decreases total portfolio standard deviation while it increases Sharpe and Sortino ratios (and also often decreases maximum drawdown) in the combined portfolios. This demonstrates that hedge funds act as both risk-adjusted return enhancers and diversifiers for the traditional stock/bond portfolio.

Market risk is the risk that arises from movements in stock prices, interest rates, exchange rates, and commodity prices. Market risk is distinguished from credit risk, which is the risk of loss from the failure of a counterparty to make a promised payment, and also from a number of other risks that organizations face, such as breakdowns in their operational procedures. In essence, market risk is the risk arising from changes in the markets to which an organization has exposure. Risk management is the process of identifying and measuring risk and ensuring that the risks being taken are consistent with the desired risks. The process of managing market risk relies heavily on the use of models. A model is a simplified representation of a real world phenomenon. Financial models attempt to capture the important elements that determine prices and sensitivities in financial markets. In doing so, they provide critical information necessary to manage investment risk. For example, investment risk models help a portfolio manager understand how much the value of the portfolio is likely to change given a change in a certain risk factor. They also provide insight into the gains and losses the portfolio might reasonably be expected to experience and the frequency with which large losses might occur. Effective risk management, though, is much more than just applying financial models. It requires the application of judgment and experience not only to know how to use the models appropriately but also to appreciate the strengths and limitations of the models and to know when to supplement or substitute one model with another model or approach. Financial markets operate more or less continuously, and new prices are constantly being generated. As a result, there is a large amount of data on market risk and a lot of collective experience dealing with this risk, making market risk one of the easier financial risks to analyze. Still, market risk is not an easy risk to capture. Although a portfolio’s exposures can be identified with some certainty, the potential losses that could arise from those exposures are unknown. The data used to estimate potential losses are generated from past prices and rates, not the ones to come. Risk management models allow the experienced risk manager to blend that historical data with their own forward-looking judgment, providing a framework within which to test that judgment. We first lay a foundation for understanding value at risk, discuss three primary approaches to estimating value at risk, and cover the primary advantages and limitations as well as extensions of value at risk. We then address the sensitivity measures used for equities, fixed-income securities, and options and also cover historical and hypothetical scenario risk measures. Next, we discuss the use of constraints in risk management, such as risk budgeting, position limits, scenario limits, stop-loss limits, and capital allocation as risk management tools. Lastly, we describe various applications and limitations of risk measures as used by different types of market participants and summarize our discussion.","The member should be able to: explain the use of value at risk (VaR) in measuring portfolio risk; compare the parametric (variance–covariance), historical simulation, and Monte Carlo simulation methods for estimating VaR; estimate and interpret VaR under the parametric, historical simulation, and Monte Carlo simulation methods; describe advantages and limitations of VaR; describe extensions of VaR; describe sensitivity risk measures and scenario risk measures and compare these measures to VaR; demonstrate how equity, fixed-income, and options exposure measures may be used in measuring and managing market risk and volatility risk; describe the use of sensitivity risk measures and scenario risk measures; describe advantages and limitations of sensitivity risk measures and scenario risk measures; explain constraints used in managing market risks, including risk budgeting, position limits, scenario limits, and stop-loss limits; explain how risk measures may be used in capital allocation decisions; describe risk measures used by banks, asset managers, pension funds, and insurers.","This reading on market risk management models covers various techniques used to manage the risk arising from market fluctuations in prices and rates. The key points are summarized as follows: Value at risk (VaR) is the minimum loss in either currency units or as a percentage of portfolio value that would be expected to be incurred a certain percentage of the time over a certain period of time given assumed market conditions. VaR requires the decomposition of portfolio performance into risk factors. The three methods of estimating VaR are the parametric method, the historical simulation method, and the Monte Carlo simulation method. The parametric method of VaR estimation typically provides a VaR estimate from the left tail of a normal distribution, incorporating the expected returns, variances, and covariances of the components of the portfolio. The parametric method exploits the simplicity of the normal distribution but provides a poor estimate of VaR when returns are not normally distributed, as might occur when a portfolio contains options. The historical simulation method of VaR estimation uses historical return data on the portfolio’s current holdings and allocation. The historical simulation method has the advantage of incorporating events that actually occurred and does not require the specification of a distribution or the estimation of parameters, but it is only useful to the extent that the future resembles the past. The Monte Carlo simulation method of VaR estimation requires the specification of a statistical distribution of returns and the generation of random outcomes from that distribution. The Monte Carlo simulation method is extremely flexible but can be complex and time consuming to use. There is no single right way to estimate VaR. The advantages of VaR include the following: It is a simple concept; it is relatively easy to understand and easily communicated, capturing much information in a single number. It can be useful in comparing risks across asset classes, portfolios, and trading units and, as such, facilitates capital allocation decisions. It can be used for performance evaluation and can be verified by using backtesting. It is widely accepted by regulators. The primary limitations of VaR are that it is a subjective measure and highly sensitive to numerous discretionary choices made in the course of computation. It can underestimate the frequency of extreme events. It fails to account for the lack of liquidity and is sensitive to correlation risk. It is vulnerable to trending or volatility regimes and is often misunderstood as a worst-case scenario. It can oversimplify the picture of risk and focuses heavily on the left tail. There are numerous variations and extensions of VaR, including conditional VaR (CVaR), incremental VaR (IVaR), and marginal VaR (MVaR), that can provide additional useful information. Conditional VaR is the average loss conditional on exceeding the VaR cutoff. Incremental VaR measures the change in portfolio VaR as a result of adding or deleting a position from the portfolio or if a position size is changed relative to the remaining positions. MVaR measures the change in portfolio VaR given a small change in the portfolio position. In a diversified portfolio, MVaRs can be summed to determine the contribution of each asset to the overall VaR. Ex ante tracking error measures the degree to which the performance of a given investment portfolio might deviate from its benchmark. Sensitivity measures quantify how a security or portfolio will react if a single risk factor changes. Common sensitivity measures are beta for equities; duration and convexity for bonds; and delta, gamma, and vega for options. Sensitivity measures do not indicate which portfolio has greater loss potential. Risk managers can use deltas, gammas, vegas, durations, convexities, and betas to get a comprehensive picture of the sensitivity of the entire portfolio. Stress tests apply extreme negative stress to a particular portfolio exposure. Scenario measures, including stress tests, are risk models that evaluate how a portfolio will perform under certain high-stress market conditions. Scenario measures can be based on actual historical scenarios or on hypothetical scenarios. Historical scenarios are scenarios that measure the portfolio return that would result from a repeat of a particular period of financial market history. Hypothetical scenarios model the impact of extreme movements and co-movements in different markets that have not previously occurred. Reverse stress testing is the process of stressing the portfolio’s most significant exposures. Sensitivity and scenario risk measures can complement VaR. They do not need to rely on history, and scenarios can be designed to overcome an assumption of normal distributions. Limitations of scenario measures include the following: Historical scenarios are unlikely to re-occur in exactly the same way. Hypothetical scenarios may incorrectly specify how assets will co-move and thus may get the magnitude of movements wrong. And, it is difficult to establish appropriate limits on a scenario analysis or stress test. Constraints are widely used in risk management in the form of risk budgets, position limits, scenario limits, stop-loss limits, and capital allocation. Risk budgeting is the allocation of the total risk appetite across sub-portfolios. A scenario limit is a limit on the estimated loss for a given scenario, which, if exceeded, would require corrective action in the portfolio. A stop-loss limit either requires a reduction in the size of a portfolio or its complete liquidation (when a loss of a particular size occurs in a specified period). Position limits are limits on the market value of any given investment. Risk measurements and constraints in and of themselves are not restrictive or unrestrictive; it is the limits placed on the measures that drive action. The degree of leverage, the mix of risk factors to which the business is exposed, and accounting or regulatory requirements influence the types of risk measures used by different market participants. Banks use risk tools to assess the extent of any liquidity and asset/liability mismatch, the probability of losses in their investment portfolios, their overall leverage ratio, interest rate sensitivities, and the risk to economic capital. Asset managers’ use of risk tools focuses primarily on volatility, probability of loss, or the probability of underperforming a benchmark. Pension funds use risk measures to evaluate asset/liability mismatch and surplus at risk. Property and casualty insurers use sensitivity and exposure measures to ensure exposures remain within defined asset allocation ranges. They use economic capital and VaR measures to estimate the impairment in the event of a catastrophic loss. They use scenario analysis to stress the market risks and insurance risks simultaneously. Life insurers use risk measures to assess the exposures of the investment portfolio and the annuity liability, the extent of any asset/liability mismatch, and the potential stress losses based on the differences between the assets in which they have invested and the liabilities resulting from the insurance contracts they have written.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2022/pdf/derivative-markets-instruments.pdf,Derivatives,2022,Level I,"Equity, fixed-income, currency, and commodity markets are facilities for trading the basic assets of an economy. Equity and fixed-income securities are claims on the assets of a company. Currencies are the monetary units issued by a government or central bank. Commodities are natural resources, such as oil or gold. These underlying assets are said to trade in cash markets or spot markets and their prices are sometimes referred to as cash prices or spot prices , though we usually just refer to them as stock prices, bond prices, exchange rates, and commodity prices. These markets exist around the world and receive much attention in the financial and mainstream media. Hence, they are relatively familiar not only to financial experts but also to the general population. Somewhat less familiar are the markets for derivatives , which are financial instruments that derive their values from the performance of these basic assets. This reading is an overview of derivatives. Subsequent readings will explore many aspects of derivatives and their uses in depth. Among the questions that this first reading will address are the following: What are the defining characteristics of derivatives? What purposes do derivatives serve for financial market participants? What is the distinction between a forward commitment and a contingent claim? What are forward and futures contracts? In what ways are they alike and in what ways are they different? What are swaps? What are call and put options and how do they differ from forwards, futures, and swaps? What are credit derivatives and what are the various types of credit derivatives? What are the benefits of derivatives? What are some criticisms of derivatives and to what extent are they well founded? What is arbitrage and what role does it play in a well-functioning financial market? This reading is organized as follows. Section 2 explores the definition and uses of derivatives and establishes some basic terminology. Section 3 describes derivatives markets. Section 4 categorizes and explains types of derivatives. Sections 5 and 6 discuss the benefits and criticisms of derivatives, respectively. Section 7 introduces the basic principles of derivative pricing and the concept of arbitrage. Section 8 provides a summary.","The member should be able to: define a derivative and distinguish between exchange-traded and over-the-counter derivatives; contrast forward commitments with contingent claims; define forward contracts, futures contracts, options (calls and puts), swaps, and credit derivatives and compare their basic characteristics; determine the value at expiration and profit from a long or a short position in a call or put option; describe purposes of, and controversies related to, derivative markets; explain arbitrage and the role it plays in determining prices and promoting market efficiency.","This first reading on derivatives introduces you to the basic characteristics of derivatives, including the following points: A derivative is a financial instrument that derives its performance from the performance of an underlying asset. The underlying asset, called the underlying, trades in the cash or spot markets and its price is called the cash or spot price. Derivatives consist of two general classes: forward commitments and contingent claims. Derivatives can be created as standardized instruments on derivatives exchanges or as customized instruments in the over-the-counter market. Exchange-traded derivatives are standardized, highly regulated, and transparent transactions that are guaranteed against default through the clearinghouse of the derivatives exchange. Over-the-counter derivatives are customized, flexible, and more private and less regulated than exchange-traded derivatives, but are subject to a greater risk of default. A forward contract is an over-the-counter derivative contract in which two parties agree that one party, the buyer, will purchase an underlying asset from the other party, the seller, at a later date and at a fixed price they agree upon when the contract is signed. A futures contract is similar to a forward contract but is a standardized derivative contract created and traded on a futures exchange. In the contract, two parties agree that one party, the buyer, will purchase an underlying asset from the other party, the seller, at a later date and at a price agreed on by the two parties when the contract is initiated. In addition, there is a daily settling of gains and losses and a credit guarantee by the futures exchange through its clearinghouse. A swap is an over-the-counter derivative contract in which two parties agree to exchange a series of cash flows whereby one party pays a variable series that will be determined by an underlying asset or rate and the other party pays either a variable series determined by a different underlying asset or rate or a fixed series. An option is a derivative contract in which one party, the buyer, pays a sum of money to the other party, the seller or writer, and receives the right to either buy or sell an underlying asset at a fixed price either on a specific expiration date or at any time prior to the expiration date. A call is an option that provides the right to buy the underlying. A put is an option that provides the right to sell the underlying. Credit derivatives are a class of derivative contracts between two parties, the credit protection buyer and the credit protection seller, in which the latter provides protection to the former against a specific credit loss. A credit default swap is the most widely used credit derivative. It is a derivative contract between two parties, a credit protection buyer and a credit protection seller, in which the buyer makes a series of payments to the seller and receives a promise of compensation for credit losses resulting from the default of a third party. An asset-backed security is a derivative contract in which a portfolio of debt instruments is assembled and claims are issued on the portfolio in the form of tranches, which have different priorities of claims on the payments made by the debt securities such that prepayments or credit losses are allocated to the most-junior tranches first and the most-senior tranches last. Derivatives can be combined with other derivatives or underlying assets to form hybrids. Derivatives are issued on equities, fixed-income securities, interest rates, currencies, commodities, credit, and a variety of such diverse underlyings as weather, electricity, and disaster claims. Derivatives facilitate the transfer of risk, enable the creation of strategies and payoffs not otherwise possible with spot assets, provide information about the spot market, offer lower transaction costs, reduce the amount of capital required, are easier than the underlyings to go short, and improve the efficiency of spot markets. Derivatives are sometimes criticized for being a form of legalized gambling and for leading to destabilizing speculation, although these points can generally be refuted. Derivatives are typically priced by forming a hedge involving the underlying asset and a derivative such that the combination must pay the risk-free rate and do so for only one derivative price. Derivatives pricing relies heavily on the principle of storage, meaning the ability to hold or store the underlying asset. Storage can incur costs but can also generate cash, such as dividends and interest. Arbitrage is the condition that two equivalent assets or derivatives or combinations of assets and derivatives sell for different prices, leading to an opportunity to buy at the low price and sell at the high price, thereby earning a risk-free profit without committing any capital. The combined actions of arbitrageurs bring about a convergence of prices. Hence, arbitrage leads to the law of one price: Transactions that produce equivalent results must sell for equivalent prices.
