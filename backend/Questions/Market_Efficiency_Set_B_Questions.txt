Topic: Market Efficiency

1. Question: According to the efficient market hypothesis, what is the relationship between intrinsic value and market value when markets are considered efficient?

Options:
A) Inefficient markets may have a large difference between intrinsic value and market value.
B) Efficient markets may have a small difference between intrinsic value and market value.
C) Inefficient markets may have a small difference between intrinsic value and market value.
D) Efficient markets may have a large difference between intrinsic value and market value.

Correct Answer: B) Efficient markets may have a small difference between intrinsic value and market value.

Justification: This question tests the candidate's understanding of market efficiency and the relationship between intrinsic value and market value in efficient markets. According to the efficient market hypothesis, when markets are efficient, the two values should be the same or very close. Therefore, option B is the correct answer as it reflects this concept. This aligns with the topic of market efficiency and its implications for fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and portfolio management.

2. Question: According to the efficient market hypothesis, what is the relationship between market value and intrinsic value when markets are efficient? 
Options: 
A. They should be the same 
B. They can diverge significantly 
C. They are irrelevant 
D. They are inversely related 

Correct Answer: A. They should be the same 

Justification: In the context of market efficiency, the efficient market hypothesis states that market prices fully reflect all available information. This means that the market value and intrinsic value of an asset should be the same or very close when markets are efficient. This is in contrast to the idea that markets can be irrational and that market value and intrinsic value can diverge significantly.

3. Question: According to the efficient market hypothesis, which form of market efficiency suggests that asset prices reflect all publicly known and available information?
Options:
A. Strong form
B. Semi-strong form
C. Weak form
D. Inefficient form
Correct Answer: B. Semi-strong form
Justification: The semi-strong form of market efficiency states that asset prices reflect all publicly known and available information. This means that investors cannot consistently generate returns in excess of those expected for the level of risk of the investment by using publicly available information, such as financial statements and news reports. This aligns with the general conclusion of the efficient market hypothesis that it is not possible to beat the market on a consistent basis.
