Options:
A. It is possible to beat the market consistently with fundamental analysis.
B. It is not possible to beat the market consistently with technical analysis.
C. It is possible to beat the market consistently by generating returns in excess of expected risk.
D. It is not possible to beat the market on a consistent basis.

Correct Answer: D. It is not possible to beat the market on a consistent basis.

Justification: The efficient market hypothesis states that it is not possible to beat the market consistently by generating returns in excess of those expected for the level of risk of the investment. This is the general conclusion drawn from the theory and evidence provided in the reading.

2. Question: According to the efficient market hypothesis, what is the relationship between intrinsic value and market value?

Options:
A) They are always equal to each other
B) They are only equal in strong-form efficient markets
C) They can diverge significantly in inefficient markets
D) They are only equal in semi-strong-form efficient markets

Correct Answer: A) They are always equal to each other

Justification: In the efficient market hypothesis, it is believed that markets are efficient and therefore, the intrinsic value and market value of an asset should be the same or very close. This is because in efficient markets, all information is already reflected in the asset price.

3. Question: What is the difference between market value and intrinsic value?

Options:
A. Market value refers to the true value of an asset, whereas intrinsic value refers to the price at which an asset can be bought or sold.
B. Market value is the price at which an asset can be bought or sold, whereas intrinsic value refers to the true value of an asset.
C. Market value is based on public information, whereas intrinsic value includes private information.
D. Market value is affected by market efficiency, whereas intrinsic value is not.

Correct Answer: B. Market value is the price at which an asset can be bought or sold, whereas intrinsic value refers to the true value of an asset.

Justification: This question tests the candidate's understanding of the difference between market value and intrinsic value, which is an important concept in market efficiency. The correct answer is B because market value is determined by supply and demand in the market, while intrinsic value is the true value of an asset based on its fundamentals. This aligns with the context that when markets are efficient, market value and intrinsic value should be the same or very close.

4. Question: Which form of market efficiency is characterized by asset prices fully reflecting all publicly known and available information?

Options:
A. Weak form
B. Semi-strong form
C. Strong form
D. Intrinsic form

Correct Answer: B. Semi-strong form

Justification: The semi-strong form of market efficiency is defined as asset prices fully reflecting all publicly known and available information. This includes information such as financial statements, economic data, and news releases. This form of efficiency is important for fundamental analysis and the choice between active and passive portfolio management.

5. Question: What is the difference between market value and intrinsic value?

Options:
A. Market value reflects past price and trading volume information, while intrinsic value reflects all publicly known and available information.
B. Intrinsic value refers to the true value of an asset, while market value refers to the price at which an asset can be bought or sold.
C. Market value is determined by the number of market participants and analyst coverage, while intrinsic value is affected by information availability.
D. Intrinsic value is relevant to technical analysis, while market value is more relevant to fundamental analysis.

Correct Answer: B. Intrinsic value refers to the true value of an asset, while market value refers to the price at which an asset can be bought or sold.

Justification: This question tests the candidate's understanding of the difference between market value and intrinsic value, which are important concepts in market efficiency and portfolio management. The correct answer is B, as intrinsic value refers to the true value of an asset, while market value is the price at which it can be bought or sold. This is supported by the reading's explanation of intrinsic and market value and their relevance to market efficiency.

6. Question: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between market value and intrinsic value in an efficient market?

Options:

B. In an efficient market, market value is always higher than intrinsic value.
C. In an efficient market, market value is always lower than intrinsic value.
D. In an efficient market, market value and intrinsic value can vary significantly.

Correct Answer: A. In an efficient market, market value and intrinsic value are always equal.

Justification: This question tests the candidate's understanding of the concept of market efficiency and its implications for fundamental analysis. According to the efficient market hypothesis, in an efficient market, asset prices reflect all available information and therefore the market value should be equal to the intrinsic value. This means that in an efficient market, it is not possible to consistently generate returns above the expected level of risk by analyzing fundamental factors. This is supported by the statement in the reading that "when markets are efficient, the two should be the same or very close."

7. Question: According to the efficient market hypothesis, which form of market efficiency suggests that asset prices reflect all publicly known and available information?
Options:
A. Weak form
B. Semi-strong form
C. Strong form
D. Intrinsic value
Correct Answer: B. Semi-strong form
Justification: The semi-strong form of market efficiency states that asset prices reflect all publicly known and available information. This includes information such as financial statements, news releases, and analyst reports. This form of efficiency has implications for fundamental analysis, as it suggests that it is not possible to consistently beat the market based on publicly available information.

8. Question: According to the efficient market hypothesis, it is not possible to consistently outperform the market by generating returns in excess of the expected level of risk, except when markets are not efficient. What is the difference between market value and intrinsic value?

Options:
A. Market value is the true value of an asset, while intrinsic value is the price at which an asset can be bought or sold.
B. Intrinsic value refers to the price at which an asset can be bought or sold, while market value is the true value of an asset.
C. Market value and intrinsic value are both used to determine asset prices in efficient markets.
D. Intrinsic value is the true value of an asset, while market value is the price at which an asset can be bought or sold in inefficient markets.

Correct Answer: B. Intrinsic value refers to the price at which an asset can be bought or sold, while market value is the true value of an asset.

Justification: According to the efficient market hypothesis, market value and intrinsic value should be the same or very close in efficient markets. However, in inefficient markets, market value and intrinsic value can diverge significantly. This highlights the importance of understanding the difference between the two values.

9. Question: Which of the following statements is true regarding the relationship between market value and intrinsic value in an efficient market?

B) In an efficient market, market value is always higher than intrinsic value.
C) In an efficient market, market value and intrinsic value can diverge significantly.
D) In an efficient market, market value is always lower than intrinsic value.

Correct Answer: C) In an efficient market, market value and intrinsic value can diverge significantly.

Justification: This question tests the candidate's understanding of the concept of market efficiency, specifically the relationship between market value and intrinsic value. The correct answer is C) because in an efficient market, market value is determined by market forces and can sometimes deviate from the intrinsic value, which is the true value of an asset. This is supported by the statement "When markets are not efficient, the two can diverge significantly" in the given context. This question also relates to the topic of market anomalies, as the divergence between market value and intrinsic value can be seen as an anomaly in an efficient market.

10. Question: Which form of market efficiency states that asset prices fully reflect all publicly known and available information?

B) Semi-strong form
C) Strong form
D) All forms are correct

Correct Answer: B) Semi-strong form

Justification: The semi-strong form of market efficiency states that asset prices reflect all publicly known and available information. This includes all past price and trading volume information as well as any current news or public announcements. This form of efficiency has implications for fundamental analysis and the choice between active and passive portfolio management.

48. Question: According to the efficient market hypothesis, what is the general conclusion about consistently beating the market and generating excess returns?

Options:
A. It is possible to consistently beat the market by generating excess returns.
B. It is not possible to consistently beat the market by generating excess returns.
C. It is only possible to beat the market in the strong form of market efficiency.
D. Market participants can only beat the market if they have access to private information.

Correct Answer: B. It is not possible to consistently beat the market by generating excess returns.

Justification: This question tests the candidate's understanding of the general conclusion drawn from the efficient market hypothesis, which is that it is not possible to beat the market on a consistent basis by generating returns in excess of those expected for the level of risk of the investment. This is supported by the evidence discussed in the reading, including the different forms of market efficiency and their implications for fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and portfolio management. The other options are either incorrect or only partially correct based on the information provided in the reading.

49. Question: What is the main conclusion drawn from the efficient market hypothesis?
Options:
A. It is possible to consistently beat the market through fundamental analysis.
B. Technical analysis is the most effective way to generate excess returns.
C. Markets are influenced by the number of participants and depth of analyst coverage.
D. It is not possible to consistently beat the market by generating excess returns.

Correct Answer: D. It is not possible to consistently beat the market by generating excess returns.

Justification: This question tests the candidate's understanding of the main conclusion drawn from the efficient market hypothesis, which is that it is not possible to consistently beat the market through generating excess returns. This is supported by the theory and evidence presented in the context, which states that markets are efficient and all available information is already reflected in asset prices. This means that it is not possible to consistently outperform the market by using fundamental or technical analysis.

50. Question: Which form of efficient market hypothesis states that asset prices fully reflect all publicly known and available information, including past price and trading volume data?

Options: 
A) Weak form
B) Semi-strong form
C) Strong form
D) Intrinsic value

Correct Answer: B) Semi-strong form

Justification: The semi-strong form of efficient market hypothesis states that asset prices reflect all publicly known and available information, which includes both past price and trading volume data. This is different from the weak form, which only considers past price and trading volume data, and the strong form, which includes both public and private information. This is important for understanding the implications for fundamental and technical analysis, as well as active and passive portfolio management.
